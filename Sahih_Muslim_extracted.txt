SSAHIHAHIH M MUSLIMUSLIM

Translator: Abd-al-Hamid Siddiqui

About the author:

Imam Muslim (Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj) was born in 202 AH in Naysabur (817/818CE) and died in 261AH 

(874/875CE)also in Naysabur. He traveled widely to gather his collection of ahadith (plural of hadith), in-

cluding to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt. Out of 300,000 hadith which he evaluated, approximately 

4,000 were extracted for inclusion into his collection based on stringent acceptance criteria. Each report in 

his collection was checked and the veracity of the chain of reporters was painstakingly established. Sunni 

Muslims consider it the second most authentic hadith collection, after Sahih Bukhari. However, it is im-

portant to realize that Imam Muslim never claimed to collect all authentic traditions as his goal was to col-

lect only traditions that all Muslims should agree on about accuracy.

Chapter 1: 

Book 001, Number 0001: 

It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who discussed about Qadr 

(Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set 

out for prilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said: Should it so happen that we come into contact with one 

of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him a bout what is 

talked  about  Taqdir  (Division  Decree).  Accidentally   we  came  across  Abdullah  ibn  Umar  ibn  al-

Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) 

on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to 

speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! there have appeared some people in our land who recite 

the Holy Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such 

people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Ab-

dullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do 

with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my 

(belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not 

believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and then, 

it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He 

further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of 

Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white 

clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us reco-

gnized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms 

on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be 

upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad 

is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and per-

form pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He 

(the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he 

would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me 

about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, 

in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree 

about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: In-

form me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship 

Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) 

again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is 

asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some 

of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and 

master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the constructi-

on of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) 

went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: 

Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy 

Prophet) remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of 

religion.

Book 001, Number 0002: 

It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that when Ma'bad discussed the problem pertai-

ning to Divine Decree, we refuted that. He (the narrator) said: I and Humaid b. Abdur-Rahman Hi-

myari argued. And they carried on the conversation about the purport of the hadith related by Kah-

mas and its chain of transmission too, and there is some variation of words.

Book 001, Number 0003: 

It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur and Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman that they said: 

We met Abdullah b. 'Umar and we discussed about the Divine Decree, and what they talked about it 

and he narrated the hadith that has been transmitted by 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) 

from the Apostle (may peace be upon him). There is a slight variation in that.

Chapter 2: What is iman and what are its Characteri-

stics

Book 001, Number 0004: 

Abu Huraira reported: One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appeared before 

the public that a man came to him and said: Prophet of Allah, (tell me) what is Iman. Upon this he 

(the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, 

His Messengers and that you affirm your faith in the Resurrection hereafter. He (again) said: Mes-

senger of Allah, (tell me) what does al-Islam signify. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Al-Islam signifies 

that you worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him and you establish obligatory prayer 

and you pay the obligatory poor-rate (Zakat) and you observe the fast of Ramadan. He (the inquirer) 

again said: Messenger of Allah, what does al-Ihsan imply? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you

this idea in your mind) that (at least) He is seeing you. He (the inquirer ) again said: Messenger of Al-

lah, when would there be the hour (of Doom)? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: The one who is asked 

about it is no better informed than the inquirer. I, however, narrate some of its signs (and these are): 

when the slave-girl will give birth to he master, when the naked, barefooted would become the 

chiefs of the people - these are some of the signs of (Doom). (Moreover) when the shepherds of the

black (camels) would exult themselves in buildings, this is one of the signs of (Doom). (Doom) is one 

of the five (happenings wrapped in the unseen) which no one knows but Allah. Then he (the Mes-

senger of Allah) recited (the verse):" Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the hour and 

He it is Who sends (down the rain) and knows that which is in the wombs and no person knows 

whatsoever he shall earn tomorrow, and a person knows not in whatsoever land he shall die. Verily 

Allah is Knowing, Aware. He (the narrator, Abu Huraira) said: Then the person turned back and 

went away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Bring that man back to me. They 

(the Companions of the Holy Prophet present there) went to bring him back, but they saw nothing 

there. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: he was Gabriel, who came to teach the people 

their religion.

This hadith is narrated to us on the authority of Muhammad b. 'Abdullah b. Numair, on the autho-

rity of Muhammad b. Bishr, on the authority of Abd Hayyan al-Taymi with the exception that in this

Ba'laha), i, e, when slave-girl gives birth to her master.

Book 001, Number 0006: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: Ask me (about matters pertaining to religion), but they (the Companions of the Holy Pro-

phet) were too much overawed out of profound respect for him to ask him (anything). In the mean-

while a man came there, and sat near his knees and said: Messenger of Allah, what al-lslam is? -to 

which he (the Holy Prophet) replied: You must not associate anything with Allah, and establish pray-

er, pay the poor-rate (Zakat) and observe (the fasts) of Ramadan. He said: You (have) told the truth. 

He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what al-Iman (the faith) is? He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you 

affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in 

Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety, He (the inquirer) said: 

You (have) told the truth. He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what al-Ihsan is? Upon this he (the 

Holy Prophet) said: (Al-Ihsan implies) that you fear Allah as if you are seeing Him, and though you 

see Him not, verily He is seeing you. He (the inquirer) said: You (have) told the truth. He (the inqui-

rer) said: When there would be the hour (of Doom)? (Upon this) he (the HolyProphet said: The one 

who is being asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer himself. I, however, narrate some 

of its signs (and these are): when you see a slave (woman) giving birth to her master - that is one of 

the signs of (Doom) ; when you see barefooted, naked, deaf and dumb (ignorant and foolish persons) 

as the rulers of the earth - that is one of the signs of the Doom. And when you see the shepherds of 

black camels exult in buildings - that is one of the signs of Doom. The (Doom) is one of the five 

things (wrapped) in the unseen. No one knows them except Allah. Then (the Holy Prophet) recited 

(the folowing verse):" Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the hour and He it is Who

sends down the rain and knows that which is in the wombs and no person knows whatsoever he 

shall earn on morrow and a person knows not in whatsoever land he shall die. Verily Allah is Kno-

wing, Aware. He (the narrator, Abu Huraira) said: Then the person stood up an (made his way). The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Bring him back to me. He was searched for, but 

they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) could not find him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) thereupon said: He was Gabriel and he wanted to teach you (things pertaining to reli-

gion) when you did not ask (them yourselves).

Chapter 3: On prayer (salat) which is one  of the pillars 

of islam

Book 001, Number 0007: 

It is reported on the authority of Talha b. 'Ubaidullah that a person with dishevelled hair, one of 

the people of Nejd, came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). We heard the hum-

ming of his voice but could not fully discern what he had been saying, till he came nigh to the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him). It was then (disclosed to us) that he was asking questions 

pertaining to Islam. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Five prayers during the 

day and the night. (Upon this he said: Am I obliged to say any other (prayer) besides these? He (the 

Holy Prophet, ) said: No, but whatever you observe voluntarily, out of your own free will, and the 

fasts of Ramadan. The inquirer said: Am I obliged to do anything else besides this? He (the Holy Pro-

phet) said: No, but whatever you do out of your own free will. And the Messenger of Allah told him 

about the Zakat (poor-rate). The inquirer said: Am I obliged to pay anything else besides this? He 

(the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free will. The man 

turned back and was saying: I would neither make any addition to this, nor will decrease anything 

out of it. The Prophet remarked: He is successful, if he is true to what he affirms.

Book 001, Number 0008: 

Another hadith, the like of which has been narrated by Malik (b. Anas) (and mentioned above) is 

also reported by Talha b. 'Ubaidullah, with the only variation that the Holy Prophet remarked: By his 

father, he shall succeed if he were true (to what he professed), or: By his father, he would enter hea-

ven if he were true (to what he professed).

It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that he said: We were forbidden that we should ask 

anything (without the genuine need) from the Holy Prophet. It, therefore, pleased us that an intelli-

gent person from the dwellers of the desert should come and asked him (the Holy Prophet) and we 

should listen to it. A man from the dwellers of the desert came (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Mu-

hammad, your messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah had sent you (as a 

prophet). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: Who created the

He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the bedouin again) said: Who raised these mountains and 

who created in them whatever is created there? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. Upon this he 

(the bedouin) remarked: By Him Who created the heaven and created the earth and raised moun-

tains thereupon, has Allah (in fact) sent you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: 

Your messenger also told us that five prayers (had been made) obligatory for us during the day and 

the night. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told you the truth. He (the bedouin) said: By Him Who

month of Ramadan. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: By Him

which takes me near to Paradise and draws me away from the Fire (of Hell). He (the narrator) said: 

The Prophet (may peace be upon him) stopped for a while and cast a glance upon his companions 

and then said: He was afforded a good opportunity (or he had been guided well). He (the Holy Pro-

phet) addressing the bedouin said: (Repeat) whatever you have uttered. He (the bedouin) repeated 

that. Upon this the Apostle (may peace be upon him) remarked: The deed which can draw you near 

to Paradise and take you away from Hell is, that you worship Allah and associate none with Him, and 

you establish prayer and pay Zakat, and do good to your kin. After having uttered these words, the 

Holy Prophet asked the bedouin to release the nosestring of his she-camel.

Abu Jamra reported: I was an interpreter between Ibn Abbas and the people, that a woman happe-

ned to come there and asked about nabidh or the pitcher of wine. He replied: A delegation of the 

people of 'Abdul-Qais came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Pro-

phet) asked the delegation or the people (of the delegation about their identity). They replied that 

they belonged to the tribe of Rabi'a. He (the Holy Prophet) welcomed the people or the delegation 

which were neither humiliated nor put to shame. They (the members of the delegation) said: Mes-

senger of Allah, we come to you from a far-off distance and there lives between you and us a tribe of 

the unbelievers of Mudar and, therefore, it is not possible for us to come to you except in the sacred 

months. Thus direct us to a clear command, about which we should inform people beside us and by 

which we may enter heaven. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: I command you to do four deeds and 

forbid you to do four (acts), and added: I direct you to affirm belief in Allah alone, and then asked 

them: Do you know what belief in Allah really implies? They said: Allah and His Messenger know 

best. The Prophet said: It implies testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and that Mu-

hammad is the messenger of Allah, establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, fast of Ramadan, that 

you pay one-fifth of the booty (fallen to your lot) and I forbid you to use gourd, wine jar, or a recep-

tacle for wine. Shu'ba sometimes narrated the word naqir (wooden pot) and sometimes narrated it as 

muqayyar. The Holy Prophet also said: Keep it in your mind and inform those who have been left be-

hind.

There is another hadith narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas (the contents of which are similar 

to the one) narrated by Shu'ba in which the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: I forbid you 

to prepare nabidh in a gourd, hollowed block of wood, a varnished jar or receptacle. Ibn Mu'adh 

made this addition on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah said to Ashajj, of the tri-

be of 'Abdul-Qais: You possess two qualities which are liked by Allah: insight and deliberateness.

municate to those who have been left behind us and by doing which we may enter heaven. Upon this 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and forbid you 

to do four (things): worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and ob-

serve the fast of Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit you from four 

(things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the 

members of the delegation) said: Do you know what al-naqir is? He replied: Yes, it is a stump which 

you hollow out and in which you throw small dates. Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word 

tamar (dates). (The Holy Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its ebulliti-

on subsides, you drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them 

(the other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the sword. He 

(the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on this very account due 

to (intoxication), and he told that he tried to conceal it out of shame from the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him). I, however, inquired from the Messenger of Allah (it we discard those 

utensils which you have forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink? He 

(the Holy Prophet) replied: In  the waterskin the mouths of which are tied  (with a string). They 

(again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot remain preserved. 

The holy Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Drink in water-skins) even if these are-

nibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj of 'Abdul-Qais he said: Verily, you possess two such 

qualities which Allah loves: insight and deliberateness.

Book 001, Number 0026: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Said al-Khudri that when the delegation of the tribe of Ab-

dul-Qais came to the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him), (its members) said: Apostle of Allah, 

may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, which beverage is good for us? He (the Prophet) 

said: (Not to speak of beverages, I would lay stress) that you should not drink in the wine jars. They 

said: Apostle of Allah, may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, do you know what al-naqir 

is? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out in the middle, and added: 

Do not use gourd or receptacle (for drink). Use water-skin the mouth of which is tied with a thong 

(for this purpose).

Allah, that I (Muhammad) am the messenger of Allah, and if they accept this, then tell them Allah 

has enjoined upon them five prayers during the day and the night and if they accept it, then tell 

them that Allah has made Zakat obligatory for them that it should be collected from the rich and dis-

tributed among the poor, and if they agree to it don't pick up (as a share of Zakat) the best of their 

wealths. Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between him and Allah.

may His Glory be Magnificent, and when they become fully aware of Allah, instruct them that He 

has enjoined five prayers on them during the day and the night, and when the begin observing it, 

then instruct them that verily Allah has made Zakat obligatory for them which would be collected 

from the wealthy amongst them and distributed to their needy ones, and when they submit to it, then 

collect it from them and avoid (the temptation) of selecting the best (items) of their riches.

the Arabs who wanted to become apostates became apostates. 'Umar b. Khattab said to Abu Bakr: 

Why would you fight against the people, when the Messenger of Allah declared: I have been directed 

to fight against people so long as they do not say: There is no god but Allah, and he who professed it 

was granted full protection of his property and life on my behalf except for a right? His (other) af-

fairs rest with Allah. Upon this Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I would definitely fight against him who se-

vered prayer from Zakat, for it is the obligation upon the rich. By Allah, I would fight against them 

even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Mes-

senger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it. Umar b. Khattab remarked: By Allah, I 

found nothing but the fact that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr for (perceiving the justifica-

tion of) fighting (against those who refused to pay Zakat) and I fully recognized that the (stand of 

Abu Bakr) was right.

cept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same statement (of Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah 

b. Abi Umayya) till Abu Talib gave his final decision and be stuck to the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib 

and refused to profess that there is no god but Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: By 

Allah, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so (by God), It was then that Al-

lah, the Magnificent and the Glorious, revealed this verse:

" It is not meet for the Prophet and for those who believe that they should beg pardon for the poly-

theists, even though they were their kith and kin, after it had been made known to them that they 

were the denizens of Hell" (ix. 113)

And it was said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):

" Verily thou canst not guide to the right path whom thou lovest. And it is Allah Who guideth 

whom He will, and He knoweth best who are the guided" (xxviii, 56).

Messenger of Allah, I wish that you should pool together what has been left out of the provisions 

with the people and then invoke (the blessings of) Allah upon it. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy 

Prophet) did it accordingly. He (the narrator) said: The one who had wheat in his possession came 

there with wheat. He who had dates with him came there with dates. And Mujahid said: He who 

possessed stones of dates came there with stones. I (the narrator) said: What did they do with the 

date-stones. They said: They (the people) sucked them and then drank water over them. He (the nar-

rator said): He (the Holy Prophet) invoked the blessings (of Allah) upon them (provisions). He (the 

narrator) said: (And there was such a miraculous increase in the stocks) that the people replenished 

their provisions fully. He (the narrator) said: At that time he (the Holy Prophet) said: I bear testimony

Allah without entertaining any doubt about these (two fundamentals) would enter heaven.

was in direct contact with the Holy Prophet. He was either Abu Huraira or Abu Sa'id Khudri. Both 

are equally reliable transmitters of the traditions). He (the narrator) said: During the time of Tabuk 

expedition, the (provisions) ran short and the men (of the army) suffered starvation; they said: Mes-

senger of Allah, would you permit us to slay our camels? We would eat them and use their fat. The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do as you please. He (the narrator) said: Then 

'Umar came there and said: Messenger of Allah, if you do that (if you give your consent and the men 

begin to slay their camels), the riding animals would become short. But (I would suggest you to) 

summon them along with the provisions left with them Then invoke Allah's blessings on them (diffe-

rent items of the provisions) It is hoped Allah shall bless them. The Messenger of Allah replied in the 

affirmative. (the narrator) said: He called for a leather mat to be used as a table cloth and spread it 

out. Then he called people along with the remaining portions of their provisions. He (the narrator) 

said: Someone was coming with handful of mote, another was coming with a handful of dates, still 

another was coming with a portion of bread, till small quantities of these things were collected on 

the table cloth. He (the narrator said): Then the messenger of Allah invoked blessing (on them) and 

said: Fill your utensils with these provisions. He (the narrator) said: They filled their vessel to the 

brim with them, and no one amongst the army (which comprised of 30,000 persons) was left even 

with a single empty vessel. He (the narrator) aid: They ate to their fill, and there was still a surplus. 

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: I bear testimony that there is 

no god but Allah and I am the messenger of Allah. The man who meets his Lord without harboring 

any doubt about these two (truths) would never be kept away from Paradise.

ship Allah and should not associate anything with Him, and the right of His bondsmen over Allah,

(the place) where God's Messenger was. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it Abu Huraira? I (Abu Hurai-

ra) replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? rep-

lied: You were amongst us but got up and went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you 

might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed. I was the first to 

be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I drew myself together as a fox does, and these people are 

following me. He addressed me as Abu Huraira and gave me his sandals and said: Take away these 

sandals of mine, and when you meet anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but 

Allah, being assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he shall go to Paradise. Now 

the first one I met was Umar. He asked: What are these sandals, Abu Huraira? I replied: These are the 

sandals of the Messenger of Allah with which he has sent me to gladden anyone I meet who testifies 

that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would 

go to Paradise. Thereupon 'Umar struck me on the breast and I fell on my back. He then said: Go 

back, Abu Huraira, So I returned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and was about 

to break into tears. 'Umar followed me closely and there he was behind me. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace and blessings be on him) said: What is the matter with you, Abu Huraira? I said: I happe-

ned to meet 'Umar and conveyed to him the message with which you sent me. He struck me on my 

breast which made me fall down upon my back and ordered me to go back. Upon this the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What prompted you to do this, 'Umar? He said: Messenger of 

Allah, my mother and father be sacrificed to thee, did you send Abu Huraira with your sandals to 

gladden anyone he met and who testified that there is no god but Allah, and being assured of it in his 

heart, with the tidings that he would go to Paradise? He said: Yes. Umar said: Please do it not, for I 

am afraid that people will trust in it alone; let them go on doing (good) deeds. The Messenger of Al-

Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) observed: If anyone testifies (sincerely from his heart) that there is 

no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His bondsman and His messenger, Allah immuned him 

from Hell. He (Mu'adh) said: Messenger of Allah, should I not then inform people of it, so that they

Did you tear his heart in order to find out whether it had professed or not? And he went on repea-

ting it to me till I wished I had embraced Islam that day. Sa'd said: By Allah, I would never kill any 

Muslim so long as a person with a heavy belly, i. e., Usama, would not kill. Upon this a person re-

marked: Did Allah not say this: And fight them until there is no more mischief and religion is wholly

what he had done He (the Prophet of Allah) called for him and asked him why he had killed him. He

even named some of them. (He continued): I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said: There 

is no god but Allah. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Did you kill him? He

Book 001, Number 0205: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira: We participated in the Battle of Hunain along with 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) said about a man who clai-

med to be a Muslim that he was one of the denizens of the Fire (of Hell). When we were in the thick 

of the battle that man fought desperately and was wounded. It was said: Messenger of Allah, the per-

son whom you at first called as the denizen of Fire fought desperately and died. Upon this the Apostle 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: He was doomed to the Fire (of Hell). Some men were on 

the verge of doubt (about his fate) when it was said that he was not dead but fatally wounded. When 

it was night he could not stand the (pain of his) wound and killed himself. The Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) was informed of that. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Allah is Great, I bear testimony to 

the fact that I am the servant of Allah and His messenger. He then commanded Bilal to announce to 

the people that none but a Muslim would enter Paradise. Verily Allah helps this faith even by a sinful 

person.

Book 001, Number 0206: 

It is reported on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi that there was an encounter between the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the polytheists, and they fought (against one ano-

ther). At the conclusion of the battle the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) bent his steps 

towards his army and they (the enemies) bent their steps towards their army. And there was a person 

(his name was Quzman and he was one of the hypocrites) among the Companions of the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) who did not spare a detached (fighter of the enemy) but pursued 

and killed him with the sword. They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: None served us bet-

ter today than this man Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: Verily 

he is one of the denizens of Fire. One of the people (Muslims) said: I will constantly shadow him. 

Then this man went out along with him. He halted whenever he halted, and ran along with him 

whenever he ran. He (the narrator) said: The man was seriously injured. He (could not stand the 

pain) and hastened his own death. He placed the blade of the sword on the ground with the tip bet-

ween his chest and then pressed himself against the sword and killed himself. Then the man (follo-

wing him) went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: I bear testimony that 

verily thou art the Messenger of Allah, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter? He replied: 

The person about whom you just mentioned that he was one among the denizens of Fire and the

people were surprised (at this) and I said to them that I would bring (the news about him) and con-

sequently I went out in search of him till I (found him ) to be very seriously injured. He hastened his 

death. He placed the blade of the sword upon the ground and its tip between his chest and then 

pressed himself against that and killed himself. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) remarked: A person performs the deeds which to the people appear to be the deeds befit-

ting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the denizens of Hell. And verily a person does an 

act which in the eyes of public is one which is done by the denizens of Hell, but the person is one 

among the dwellers of Paradise.

It is reported on the authority of Hasan: A person belonging to the people of the past suffered from 

a boil, when it pained him, he drew out an arrow from the quiver and pierced it. And the bleeding

ched his hand towards the mosque and said: By God, Jundab transmitted this hadith to me from the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in this very mosque.

It is reported on the authority of Hasan: Jundab b. 'Abdullah al-Bajali narrated this hadith in this 

mosque which we can neither forget and at the same time we have no apprehension that Jundab

served: A person belonging to the people of the past suffered from a boil, and then the rest of the ha-

dith was narrated.

Companions of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) came there and said: So and so is a martyr, till 

they happened to pass by a man and said: So and so is a martyr. Upon this the Messenger of Allah re-

marked: Nay, not so verily I have seen him in the Fire for the garment or cloak that he had stolen 

from the booty, Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Umar son of Khattab, go 

and announce to the people that none but the believers shall enter Paradise. He ('Umar b. Khattab) 

narrated: I went out and proclaimed: Verily none but the believers would enter Paradise.

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira: We went to Khaibar along with the Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) and Allah granted us victory. We plundered neither gold nor silver but laid our 

hands on goods, corn and clothes, and then bent our stops to a valley; along with the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) there was a slave who was presented to him by one Rifa'a b. Zaid of 

the family of Judham, a tribe of Dubayb. When we got down into the valley the slave of the Messen-

ger of Allah stood up and began to unpack the saddle-bag and was suddenly struck by a (stray) ar-

row which proved fatal. We said: There is a greeting for him, Messenger of Allah, as he is a martyr. 

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: Nay, not so. By Him in Whose 

hand is the life of Muhammad, the small garment which he stole from the booty on the day of Khai-

bar but which did not (legitimately) fall to his lot is burning like the Fire (of Hell) on him. The people 

were greatly perturbed (on hearing this). A person came there with a lace or two laces and said: 

Messenger of Allah, I found (them) on the day of Khaibar. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: This is a 

lace of fire or two laces of fire.

Book 001, Number 0211: 

It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that Tufail son of Amr al-Dausi came to the Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) and said: Do you need strong, fortified protection? The tribe of Daus had a fort 

in the pre-Islamic days. The Apostle (may peace be upon him) declined this offer, since it (the privi-

lege of protecting the Holy Prophet) had already been reserved for the Ansar. When the Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) migrated to Medina, Tufail son of Amr also migrated to that place, and there also 

migrated along with him a man of his tribe. But the climate of Medina did not suit him, and he fell 

sick. He felt very uneasy. So he took hold of an iron head of an arrow and cut his finger-joints. The 

blood streamed forth from his hands, till he died. Tufail son of Amr saw him in a dream. His state 

was good and he saw him with his hands wrapped. He (Tufail) said to him: What treatment did your 

Allah accord to you? He replied. Allah granted me pardon for my migration to the Apostle (may pe-

ace be upon him): He (Tufail) again said: What is this that I see you wrapping up your hands? He re-

plied: I was told (by Allah): We would not set right anything of yours which you damaged yourself. 

Tufail narrated this (dream) to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Upon this he pray-

ed: O Allah I grant pardon even to his hands.

and he deliberately avoided coming to the Apostle (may peace be upon him). The Apostle (may peace 

be upon him) asked Sa'd b, Mu'adh about him and said, Abu Amr, how is Thabit? Has he fallen sick? 

Sa'd said: He is my neighbour, but I do not know of his illness. Sa'd came to him (Thabit), and con-

louder than that of the Messenger of Allah, and so I am one amongst the denizens of Fire, Sa'd Infor-

was about to die. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: Did the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him not give you tidings of this? Did the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) not give you tidings of this? He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (to-

wards the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is 

no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah. Verily I have passed through three 

phases. (The first one) in which I found myself averse to none else more than I was averse to the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and there was no other desire stronger in me than the 

one that I should overpower him and kill him. Had I died in this state, I would have been definitely 

one of the denizens of Fire. When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle 

(may peace be upon him) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that may pledge my allegiance to 

you. He stretched out his right hand, I withdrew my hand, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has 

happened to you, O 'Amr? replied: I intend to lay down some condition. He asked: What condition do 

you intend to put forward? I said: should be granted pardon. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are 

you not aware of the fact that Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds)? Verily migration wipes 

out all the previous (misdeeds), and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds. And 

then no one as or dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime in my eyes 

than he, Never could I, pluck courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendour. So if I 

am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for I have not eyed him fully. Had I died in this 

state had every reason to hope that I would have bee among the dwellers of Paradise. Then we were 

responsible for certain things (in the light of which) I am unable to know what is in store for me. 

When I die, let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave 

well with earth, then stand around it for the time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is 

distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) ascertain what answer I can 

give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.

good. But if you inform us that there is atonement of our past deeds (then we would embrace Islam). 

Then it was revealed:

And those who call not unto another god along with Allah and slay not any soul which Allah has 

forbidden except in the cause of justice, nor commit fornication; and he who does this shall meet the 

requital of sin. Multiplied for him shall be the torment on the Day of Resurrection, and he shall the-

rein abide disgraced, except him who repents a believes and does good deeds. Then these! for the Al-

lah shall change their vices into virtues. Verily Allah is Ever Forgiving, Merciful (xxv. 68-70).

everything Potent" (ii. 284). the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt 

it hard and severe and they came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and sat down 

on their knees and said: Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties which were within our 

power to perform, such as prayer, fasting, struggling (in the cause of Allah), charity. Then this (the 

above-mentioned) verse was revealed unto you and it is beyond our power to live up to it. The Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you intend to say what the people of two books 

(Jews and Christians) said before you:" We hear and disobey"? You should rather say:" We hear and 

we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return." And they said:" We hear 

and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, Our Lord! and unto Thee is the return." When the people re-

cited it and it smoothly flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterwards:" The 

Apostle believes in that which is sent down unto him from his Lord, and so do the believers. Each one 

believes in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Apostles, saying: We differentiate not bet-

ween any of His Apostles and they say: We hearken and we obey: (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our 

Lord! and unto Thee is the return" (ii. 285). When they did that, Allah abrogated this (verse) and the 

Great, Majestic Allah revealed:" Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it 

earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a mistake." 

(The Prophet said: ) Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. 

(The Prophet said: ) Yes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) which we have not the strength to 

bear (The Prophet said: ) Yes, and pardon us and grant us protection! and have mercy on us. Thou 

art our Patron, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people" (ii. 286). He (the Lord) said: Yes.

(may peace be upon him) observed: Say: We have heard and obeyed and submitted ourselves. He (the 

reporter) said: Allah instilled faith in their hearts and He revealed this verse:" Allah burdens not a 

soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, 

call us not to account if we forget or make a mistake. He the (Lord) said: I indeed did it. Our Lord! do 

not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. He (our Lord) said: I indeed did it. And

it occurs to him to do evil, but he does not commit it, I forgive that. But if he commits it, I record one 

evil against his name. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed. The angels said: 

That bondsman of Yours intends to commit evil. though His Lord is more Vigilant than he. Upon this 

He (the Lord) said: Watch him; if he commits (evil), write it against his name but if he refrains from 

doing it, write one good deed or him, for he desisted from doing it for My sake. The Messenger of Al-

lah said: He who amongst you is good of faith, all his good acts are multiplied from ten to seven hun-

Rahman told the truth. This (command) has been revealed in my case. There was a piece of land in 

Yemen over which I and another person had a claim. I brought the dispute with him to the Apostle 

of Allah (to decide) He (the Holy Prophet) said: Can you produce an evidence (in your support)? I 

said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: (Then the decision would be made) on his oath. I said: He 

would readily take an oath. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: 

He who perjured for appropriating the wealth of a Muslim, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah

There was a dispute between me and another person in regard to a well. We referred this dispute to

you)? He replied in the negative. He (the Apostle of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his

mant) was Imru'l-Qais b. 'Abis al-Kindi and his opponent was Rabi'a b. 'Iban He (the Holy Prophet) 

said (to the claimant): Have you evidence (to substantiate your claim)? He replied: I have no evi-

dence. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: Then his (that is of the defendant) is the 

oath. He (the claimant) said: In this case he (the defendant) would appropriate this (the property). He 

(the Holy Prophet) said: There is than no other way left for you but this. He (the narrator) said: When

Chapter 65: Removal of trustworthiness and faith from

Book 001, Number 0265: 

Hudhaifa reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) narrated to us two ahadith. I 

have seen one (crystallized into reality), and I am waiting for the other. He told us: Trustworthiness 

descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of people. Then the Qur'an was revealed and they 

learnt from the Qur'an and they learnt from the Sunnah. Then he (the Holy Prophet) told us about 

the removal of trustworthiness. He said: The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness 

would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep 

and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you 

rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it. 

He (the Holy Prophet) then took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said): The people 

would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would be left who would 

return (things) entrusted to him. (And there would be so much paucity of honest persons) till it 

would be said: There in such a such tribe is a trustworthy man. And they would also say about a per-

son: How prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in his heart the-

re would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed. I have passed through a time in which I 

did not care with whom amongst you I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith 

would compel him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, the ruler 

would compel him to discharge his obligations to me. But today I would not enter into a transaction 

with you except so and so.

Who amongst you has heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) talking about the tur-

moil? Some people said: It is we who heard it. Upon this be remarked: Perhaps by turmoil you presu-

me the unrest of man in regard to his household or neighbour, they replied: Yes. He ('Umar) obser-

ved: Such (an unrest) would be done away with by prayer, fasting and charity. But who amongst you 

has heard from the Apostle (may peace be upon him) describing that turmoil which would come like 

the wave of the ocean. Hudhaifa said: The people hushed into silence, I replied: It is I. He ('Umar) 

said: Ye, well, your father was also very pious. Hudhaifa said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be, upon him ) observing: Temptations will be presented to men's hearts as reed mat is woven 

stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any 

heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two 

types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, 

so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel 

which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated 

with passion. Hudhaifa said: I narrated to him ('Umar): There is between you and that (turmoil) a 

closed door, but there is every likelihood of its being broken. 'Umar said: Would it be broken? You 

have, been rendered fatherless. Had it been opened, it would have been perhaps closed also. I said: 

No, it would be broken, and I narrated to him: Verily that door implies a person who would be killed 

or die. There is no mistake in this hadith. Abu Khalid narrated: I said to Sa'd, O Abu Malik, what do 

you mean by the term" Aswad Murbadda"? He replied: High degree of whiteness in blackness. I said:

se hand is my life, the son of Mary (may peace be upon him) will soon descend among you as a just 

judge. He will break crosses, kill swine and abolish Jizya and the wealth will pour forth to such an 

extent that no one will accept it.

Book 001, Number 0288: 

The same hadith is transmitted from Zuhri with the same chain of transmission. But in the traditi-

on narrated by Ibn 'Uyaina the words are:" impartial leader and just judge" and in the tradition nar-

rated by Yunus: the" judge judging with justice" and" impartial leader" are not mentioned. And in the 

hadith narrated by Salih like the one transmitted by Laith the words are:" impartial judge". And in the 

hadith transmitted by Ziyad the words are:" Till one sajda is better than the worldand what it con-

tains. Then Abu Huraira used to say," recite" if you like: Not one of the People of the Book will fail to 

believe in him before his death.

Book 001, Number 0289: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger or Allah (may peace be upon 

him) observed: I swear by Allah that the son of Mary will certainly descend as a just judge and he

would definitely break the cross, and kill swine and abolish Jizya and would leave the young she-ca-

mel and no one would endeavour to (collect Zakat on it). Spite, mutual hatred and jealousy against 

one another will certainly disappear and when he summons people to accept wealth, not even one 

would do so.

Book 001, Number 0290: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon

be an Imam amongst you?

Book 001, Number 0291: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) as saying: What would you do when the son of Mary would descend and lead you?

Book 001, Number 0292: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) observed: What would you do when the son of Mary would descend amongst you and would 

lead you as one amongst you? Ibn Abi Dhi'b on the authority of Abu Huraira narrated: Your leader 

amongst you. Ibn Abi Dhi'b said: Do you know what the words:" He would lead as one amongst you" 

mean? I said: Explain these to me. He said: He would lead you according to the Book of your: Lord 

(hallowed be He and most exalted) and the Sunnah of your Apostle (may peace be upon him).

Book 001, Number 0293: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: A section 

of my people will not cease fighting for the Truth and will prevail till the Day of Resurrection. He 

said: Jesus son of Mary would then descend and their (Muslims') commander would invite him to 

come and lead them in prayer, but he would say: No, some amongst you are commanders over some 

(amongst you). This is the honour from Allah for this Ummah.

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: The (Last) Hour shall not came till the sun rises from the place of its setting And on the day 

when it rises from the place of its setting even if all the people together affirmed their faith, it would 

not be of any avail to one who did not believe previously and derived no good out of his belief.

Book 001, Number 0295: 

This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters, Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ibn Nu-

mair, Abu Kuraib, Ibn Fudail.

Book 001, Number 0296: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) observed: When three things appear faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed 

or has derived no good from his faith: the rising of the sun in its place of setting, the Dajjal, and the 

beast of the earth.

Book 001, Number 0297: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He 

(the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Thro-

ne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you 

came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it rea-

ches its place of rest under the Throne and falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is asked: 

Rise up and return to the place whence you came, and it returns and emerges out from it rising place 

and the it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything ( unusual in it) till it 

reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it would be said to it: Rise up and emerge out from 

the place of your setting, and it will rise from the place of its setting. The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said. Do you know when it would happen? It would happen at the time when 

faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith.

Book 001, Number 0298: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) one 

day said: Do you know where the sun goes? The remaining part of the hadith is the same.

Book 001, Number 0299: 

Abu Dharr reported: I entered the mosque and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

was sitting there. When the sun disappeared (from the sight) he said: O Abu Dharr! Do you know 

136 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

where it goes? He (the narrator) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) said. 

Verily it goes and begs permission, for prostration (to Allah) and the permission is granted to it. Once 

it would be said: Return to the place whence you came, and then it would rise from its setting place. 

Then he, after the recitation of 'Abdullah recited it: And that is its appointed term.

Book 001, Number 0300: 

Abu Dharr reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) the (implication of 

the) words of Allah, the Exalted: The sun glides to its appointed resting place. He replied: Its appoin-

ted resting place is under the Throne.

Chapter 74: The beginning of revelation to the messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

Book 001, Number 0301: 

A'isha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported: The first (form) with 

which was started the revelation to the Messenger of Allah was the true vision in sleep. And he did 

not see any vision but it came like the bright gleam of dawn. Thenceforth solitude became dear to 

him and he used to seclude himself in the cave of Hira', where he would engage in tahannuth (and 

that is a worship for a number of nights) before returning to his family and getting provisions again 

for this purpose. He would then return to Khadija and take provisions for a like period, till Truth 

came upon him while he was in the cave of Hira'. There came to him the angel and said: Recite, to 

which he replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me [the Apostle said] and pressed me, till I was 

hard pressed; thereafter he let me off and said: Recite. I said: I am not lettered. He then again took 

hold of me and pressed me for the second time till I was hard pressed and then let me off and said: 

Recite, to which I replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me and pressed me for the third time, till 

I was hard pressed and then let me go and said: Recite in the name of your Lord Who created, crea-

ted man from a clot of blood. Recite. And your most bountiful Lord is He Who taught the use of pen, 

taught man what he knew not (al-Qur'an, xcvi. 1-4). Then the Prophet returned therewith, his heart 

was trembling, and he went to Khadija and said: Wrap me up, wrap me up! So they wrapped him till 

the fear had left him. He then said to Khadija: O Khadija! what has happened to me? and he infor-

med her of the happening, saying: I fear for myself. She replied: It can't be. Be happy. I swear by Al-

lah that He shall never humiliate you. By Allah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you 

bear people's burden, you help the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitu-

des which affect people. Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzza, and he 

was the son of Khadija's uncle, i. e., the brother of her father. And he was the man who had embra-

ced Christianity in the Days of Ignorance (i. e. before Islam) and he used to write books in Arabic 

137 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

and, therefore, wrote Injil in Arabic as God willed that he should write. He was very old and had be-

come blind Khadija said to him: O uncle! listen to the son of your brother. Waraqa b. Naufal said: O 

my nephew! what did you see? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), then, informed 

him what he had seen, and Waraqa said to him: It is namus that God sent down to Musa. Would that 

I were then (during your prophetic career) a young man. Would that I might be alive when your 

people would expel you! The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Will they drive me 

out? Waraqa said: Yes. Never came a man with a like of what you have brought but met hostilities. If 

I see your day I shall help you wholeheartedly.

Book 001, Number 0302: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha with another chain of narrators like one 

transmitted by Yunus, i. e. the first thing with which the revelation was initiated with the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) except the words: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you, and 

Khadija said: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.

Book 001, Number 0303: 

This hadith has been reported from 'A'isha by another chain of transmitters and the words are: He 

(the Holy Prophet) came to Khadija an his heart was trembling. The rest of the hadith has been nar-

rated like one transmitted by Yunus and Ma'mar, but the first part is not mentioned, i. e. the first 

thing with which was started the revelation to the Holy Prophet was the true vision. And these words 

like those transmitted by Yunus are mentioned thus: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you. And 

there is also a mention of the words of Khadija: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.

Book 001, Number 0304: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansari who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) reportedThe Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) told about the intermission 

of revelation and narrated While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky, and raising my head I 

saw the angel who had come to me in Hira', sitting on a Throne between heaven and earth I was ter-

ror-stricken on that account and came back (to my family) and said: Wrap me up, wrap me up! So 

they wrapped me up, and the Blessed and Most Exalted Allah sent down:" You who are shrouded, 

arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse, and defilement shun," and" defi-

lement" means idols; and then the revelation was followed continuously.

Book 001, Number 0305: 

It is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Abdullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) says: The wahi was intermitted for me for a small span of time and while I was 

walking, and then the hadith like the one narrated by Yunus was transmitted but with the exception 

138 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

of these words: I was terror-stricken till I fell on the ground. Abu Salama said: Defilement means 

idols. After this the revelation was speeded up and followed rapidly.

Book 001, Number 0306: 

This hadith, the like of one narrated by Yunus has also been transmitted by Ma'mar on the autho-

rity of al-Zuhri who narrated: Allah the Most Glorious and Exalted revealed this:" You who are 

shrouded, arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse and defilement shun," 

before making the prayer obligatory. I felt terror-stricken as narrated by Uqail.

Book 001, Number 0307: 

Yahya reported: I asked Abu Salama what was revealed first from the Qur'an. He said:" 0, the 

shrouded one." I said: Or" Recite." Jabir said: I am narrating to you what was narrated to us by the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: I stayed in Hira' for one month and when my 

stay was completed, I come down and went into the heart of the valley. Somebody called me aloud. I 

looked in front of me, behind me, on the right of my side and on my left, but I did not see any body. I 

was again called and I looked about but saw nothing. I was called again and raised my head, and 

there on the Throne in the open atmosphere he, i. e. Gabriel (peace be upon him) was sitting. I began 

to tremble on account of fear. I came to Khadija and said: Wrap me up. They wrapped me up and 

threw water on me and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent down this: you who are shrouded! arise 

and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse."

Book 001, Number 0308: 

Yahya b Abi Kathir has reported this hadith with the same chain of transmitters and narrated: And 

there he was sitting on the Throne between the heaven and the earth.

ler than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and 

came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I

entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel 

of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. 

Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked 

who he was. He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Mu-

hammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the 

door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my 

good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of hea-

ven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who 

is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed 

been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered 'Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be 

upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I 

was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who 

are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (may 

peace be upon him). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The 

gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of 

(world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth 

heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? 

He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he 

been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris 

was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the 

Glorious, has said:" We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position" (Qur'an xix. 57). Then he ascen-

ded with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? 

He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he 

been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was 

with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I 

was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was 

said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was 

said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and 

there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. 

Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is 

he? He said: Gabriel It was said. Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon 

him.) It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was ope-

ned for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-

Ma'mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again. 

Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big 

earthenware  vessels.   And  when   it  was  covered   by   the  Command  of   Allah,  it  underwent  such  a 

change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty.

Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and 

night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined 

140 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the 

number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the 

children of Isra'il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. 

(The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five 

(prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord 

and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and 

Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each 

being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do 

it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; where-

as he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does 

it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed 

him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Al-

lah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.

Book 001, Number 0310: 

It is narrated on the the outhority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: (the angels) came to me and took me to the Zamzam and my heart was opened and 

washed with the water of Zamzam and then I was left (at my place).

Book 001, Number 0311: 

Anas b. Malik reported that Gabriel came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) while 

he was playing with his playmates. He took hold of him and lay him prostrate on the ground and 

tore open his breast and took out the heart from it and then extracted a blood-clot out of it and said: 

That was the part of Satan in thee. And then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a golden ba-

sin and then it was joined together and restored to it place. The boys came running to his mother, i. e. 

his nurse, and said: Verily Muhammad has been murdered. They all rushed toward him (and found 

him all right) His color was changed, Anas said. I myself saw the marks of needle on his breast.

Book 001, Number 0312: 

Anas b. Malik, while recountig the Night journey of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), 

from the mosque of Ka'bah, reported: Three beings (angels) came to him in the osque of the Ka'bah, 

while he was sleeping in the sacred mosque before it (the Command of Night Journey and Accensi-

on) was revealed to him. The rest of the hadith is narrated like that of Thabit. However, some porti-

ons have occurred before and some of them have occurred after; some have been added and some 

deleted.

Anas b. Malik reported: Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened 

my heart and then washed it with the water of Zamzam. He then brought a gold basin full of wis-

dom and faith and after emptying it into my breast, he closed it up. Then taking me by he hand, he 

ascended with me to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardi-

an of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked 

whe he there was someone with him. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he 

had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest 

heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. When he loo-

ked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said: Welcome to the 

righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam (pe-

ace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those 

of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the in-

mates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his 

left side, he wept. Then Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven. He asked its guardian to 

open (its gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven had 

said. He (opened it). Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that he found in the hea-

vens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of them), but he did not ascertain 

as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in 

the sixth heaven. When Gabriel and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed by Idris 

(peace be upon him) he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. He (the narra-

tor) said: He then proceeded and said: Who is he? Gabriel replied: It is Idris. Then I passed by Moses 

(peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said to 

(Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: It is Moses. Then I passed by Jesus and he said: Welcome to the 

righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said (to Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: Jesus, son of Mary. 

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He said: Welcome to the 

righteous apostle and righteous son. I asked: Who is he? He (Gabriel) replied: It is Abraham. Ibn Shi-

hab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a 

height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I retur-

ned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on 

thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: 

Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my 

Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and in-

formed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. 

I then went back to my Lord and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been 

said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I

said: I feel ashamed of my Lord. Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest lote-tree 

Many a colour had covered it which I do not know. Then I was admitted to Paradise and saw in it 

domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.

Book 001, Number 0314: 

Anas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa', perhaps a person of his tribe, that the 

Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was near the House (i. e. Ka'bah) in a state between 

sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone say: He is the third among the two persons. Then he 

came to  me and took me with  him. Then a golden  basin containing the  water of  Zamzam was 

brought to me and my heart was opened up to such and such (part). Qatada said: I asked him who 

was with me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part). He replied: (It means that 

it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues): My heart was ex-

tracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was restored in its original position, 

after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was then brought a white beast which is called al-

Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I 

was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven. Gabriel asked for the 

(gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was again said: Who is with 

thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him). It was said: Has he been sent for? He (Ga-

briel) said: Yes. He (the Prophet) said: Then (the gate) was opened for us (and it was said): Welcome 

unto him! His is a blessed arrival. Then we came to Adam (peace be upon him). And he (the narra-

tor) narrated the whole account of the hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the 

second heaven, Yahya (peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the 

fourth, Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). Then we travelled on till we 

reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted him and he said: 

Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet. And when I passed (by him) he wept, and a 

voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep? He said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou 

hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my 

followers. Then we travelled on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim. He (the 

narrator) narrat- ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) told that he 

saw four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits): two manifest ri-

vers and two hidden rivers. I said: ' Gabriel! what are these rivers? He replied: The two hidden rivers 

are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. 

Then the Bait-ul-Ma'mur was raised up to me. I said: O Gabriel! what is this? He replied: It is the 

Bait-ul-Ma'mur. Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never re-

turn again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the second one 

contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It was said: You did right. Al-

lah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the natural course. Then fifty prayers daily were 

made obligatory for me. And then he narrated the rest of the hadith to the end.

ting his night journey observed: Musa (peace be upon him) was a man of high stature as if he was of

'Imran (peace be upon him), a man light brown in complexion, tall. well-built as if he was one of the 

men of the Shanu'a, and saw Jesus son of Mary as a medium-statured man with white and red com-

plexion and crisp hair, and I was shown Malik the guardian of Fire, and Dajjal amongst the signs 

which were shown to me by Allah. He (the narrator) observed: Then do not doubt his (i. e. of the

Abu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

the valley of Azraq, and he observed: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him) co-

ming down from the mountain track, and he is calling upon Allah loudly (saying: Here I am! at your 

service! ). Then he came to the mountain track of Harsha. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which is this 

mountain track? They said: It is the mountain track of Harsha. He observed (I feel) as If I am seeing 

Yunus (Jonah-peace be upon him) son of Matta on a well- built red dromedary, with a cloak of wool 

around him and the rein of his dromedary is made of the fibres of date-palm, and he is calling upon 

Allah (saying: Here I am! at your service, my Lord! ). Ibn Hanbal said in the hadith narrated by him: 

Hushaim said that the meaning of khulba was fibre of date-palm.

Abu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said: We travelled with the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) between Mecca and Medina and we passed by a valley. He 

(the Holy Prophet) asked: Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq Upon this he 

(the Holy Prophet) remarked: (I feel) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him), and then he des-

cribed something about his complexion and hair, which Diwud (the narrator) could not remember. 

He (Moses, as described by the Holy Prophet) was keeping his fingers in his ears and was responding 

loudly to Allah (saying: I am as Thy service, my Lord) while passing through that valley. We then 

travelled (further) till we came to the mountain trail. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which mountain 

trail is this? They said: It is the Harsha or Lift. He (the Holy Prophet) said: (I perceive) as if I am seeing 

Yunus on a red camel, with a cloak of wool around him. The halter of his camel was that of the fibre 

of date-palm, and he was passing through the valley saying: I am at Thy service! my Lord.

he is a well-built man with wheat complexion (riding) on a red camel with its halter made of the fi-

bre of date-palm (and I perceive) as if I am seeing towards him as he is going down in the valley

amongst his children I have the greatest resemblance with him. He said: There were brought to me 

two vessels. In one of them was milk and in the other one there was wine. And it was said to me: Se-

lect any one you like. So I selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) said: You

amongst the fair-complexioned men that you ever saw. He had a lock of hair the most beautiful of 

the locks that you ever saw. He had combed it. Water was trickling out of them. He was leaning on 

two men, or on the shoulders of two men, and he was circumscribing the Ka'bah. I asked, What is 

he? It was said: He is al-Masih son of Mary. Then I saw another person, stout and having too much 

curly hair, and blind in his right eye as if it was a full swollen grape. I asked Who is he? It was said: 

He is al-Masih al-Dajjal.

lah (hallowed be He and High) is not blind of one eye. Behold, but the Masih al-Dajjal is blind of 

right eye as if his eye is like a swollen grape, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: I was shown in a dream in the night that near the Ka'bah there was a man fair-complexioned, 

fine amongst the white-complexioned men that you ever saw, his locks of hair were falling on his 

shoulders. He was a man whose hair were neither too curly nor too straight, and water trickled 

down from his head. He was placing his bands on the shoulders of two persons and amidst them was 

making a circuit around the Ka'bah. I said: Who is he? They replied: Al-Masih son of Mary. And I 

saw behind him a man with intensely curly hair, blind of right eye. Amongst the persons I have ever 

seen Ibn Qatan has the greatest resemblance with him. He was making a circuit around the Ka'bah 

by placing both his hands on the shoulders of two persons. I said: Who is he? They said; It is al-Ma-

sih al-Dajjal.

was flowing from his head or water was falling from his head. I said: Who is he? They answered: He 

is the son of Mary. Then I moved forward and cast a glance and there was a bulky man of red com-

plexion with thick locks of hair on his head, blind of one eye as it his eye was a swollen grape. I as-

ked: Who is he? They said: He is Dajjal. He had close resemblance with Ibn Qatan amongst men.

ked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very 

much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before. Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my 

eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about whatever they questioned me I also 

saw myself among the group of apostles. I saw Moses saying prayer and found him to be a well-built 

man as if he was a man of the tribe of Shanu'a. I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) offering 

prayer, of all of men he had the closest resemblance with 'Urwa b. Masu'd al-Thaqafi. I saw Ibrahim 

(peace be upon him) offering prayer; he had the closest resemblance with your companion (the Pro-

phet himself) amongst people. When the time of prayer came I led them. When I completed the 

prayer, someone said: Here is Malik, the keeper of the Hell; pay him salutations. I turned to him, but 

he preceded me in salutation.

Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the

low Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be

knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would es-

cape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. 

When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell 

such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated 

anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god 

but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-

fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has for-

bidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been 

burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt 

carried by flood.

Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter 

Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air 

has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish 

that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you 

would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give 

his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the 

Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes 

him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah 

would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything 

besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: 

O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps 

you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and 

covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he 

would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty 

and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain si-

lent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did 

you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had 

granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do 

not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, 

Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. 

When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah 

would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Al-

lah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. 'Ata' b. Yazid said: Abu Sa'id al-Khu-

dri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when

would be asked: Have you expressed your desire? He would say: Yes. Then He (Allah) would say: For 

thee is (granted) what thou desirest, and the like of it along with it.

Book 001, Number 0352: 

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: Some people during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) said: Messenger of Allah! shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Yes, and added: Do you feel any trouble in seeing 

the sun at noon with no cloud over it, and do you feel trouble in seeing the moon (open) in the full 

moonlit night with no cloud over it? They said: No, Messenger of Allah! He (the Holy Prophet) said: 

You will not feel any trouble in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection any more than you do in 

seeing any one of them. When the Day of Resurrection comes a Mu'adhdhin (a proclaimer) would 

proclaim: Let every people follow what they used to worship. Then all who worshipped idols and 

stones besides Allah would fall into the Fire, till only the righteous and the vicious and some of the 

people of the Book who worshipped Allah are left. Then the Jews would be summoned, and it would 

be said to them: What did you worship? They will say: We worshipped 'Uzair, son of Allah. It would 

be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah had never had a spouse or a son. What do you want now? They 

would say: We feel thirsty, O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain di-

rection) and asked: Why don't you go there to drink water? Then they would be pushed towards the 

Fire (and they would find to their great dismay that) it was but a mirage (and the raging flames of 

fire) would be consuming one another, and they would fall into the Fire. Then the Christians would 

be summoned and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They would say: We worshipped 

Jesus, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah did not take for Himself either a 

spouse or a son. Then it would be said to them: What do you want? They would say: Thirsty we are, 

O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don't

you go there to get water? But they would be pushed and gathered together towards the Hell, which 

was like a mirage to them, and the flames would consume one another. They would fall Into the Fire, 

till no one is left except he who worshipped Allah, be he pious or sinful. The Lord of the Universe, 

Glorified and Exalted, would come to them in a form recognisable to them and say; What are you 

looking for? Every people follow that which they worshipped. They would say: Our Lord, we kept 

ourselves separate from the people in the world, though we felt great need of them; we, however, did 

not associate ourselves with them. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge 

with Allah from thee and do not associate anything with Allah. They would repeat it twice or thrice, 

till some of them would be about to return. It would be said: Is there any sign between you and Him 

by which you will recognise Him? They would say: Yes. and the things would be laid bare. Those 

who used to prostrate themselves before God of their own accord would be permitted by God to pro-

strate themselves. But there would remain none who used to prostrate out of fear (of people) and os-

tentation but Allah would make his back as one piece, and whenever he would attempt to prostrate 

he would fall on his back. Then they would raise their heads and He would assume the Form in 

which they had seen Him the first time and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our 

Lord. Then the bridge would be set up over the Hell and intercession would be allowed and they will 

say: O God, keep safe, keep safe.

It was asked: Messenger of Allah, what is this bridge? He said: The void in which one Is likely to 

slip. There would be hooks, tongs, spits like the thorn that is found in Najd and is known as Sa'dan. 

The believers would then pass over within the twinkling of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a 

bird, like the finest horses and camels. Some will escape and be safe, some will be lacerated and let 

go, and some will be pushed into the fire of Hell till the believers will find rescue from the Fire. By 

One in Whose hand is my life, there will be none among you more eager to claim a right than the 

believers on the Day of Resurrection for (saying their) brethren in the Fire who would say: O our 

Lord, they were fasting along with us, and praying and performing pilgrimage. It will be said to 

them: Take out those whom you recognise. Then their persons would be forbidden to the Fire; and 

they would take out a large number of people who had been overtaken by Fire up to the middle of 

the shank or up to the knees. They would then say: O our Lord I not one of those about whom Thou 

didst give us command remains in it. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts 

you find good of the weight of a dinar Then they will take out a large number of people. Then they 

would say: O our Lord! we have not left anyone about whom You commanded us. He will then say: 

Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good. Then they will 

take out a large number of people, and would say: O our Lord! not one of those about whom Thou 

commanded us we have left in it. Then He would say: Go back and in whose heart you find good to 

the weight of a particle bring him out. They would bring out a large number of people, and would 

then say: O our Lord, now we have not left anyone in it (Hell) having any good in him.

Abu Sa'id Khudri said: If you don't testify me in this hadith, then recite if you like:" Surely Allah 

wrongs not the weight of an atom; and if it is a good deed. He multiplies it and gives from Himself a 

great reward" (al-Qur'an, iv. 40). Then Allah, Exalted and Great, would say: The angels have interce-

ded, the apostles have interceded and the believers have interceded, and no one remains (to grant 

pardon) but the Most Merciful of the mercifuls. He will then take a handful from Fire and bring out 

from it people who never did any good and who had been turned into charcoal, and will cast them 

into a river called the river of life, on the outskirts of Paradise. They will come out as a seed comes 

cut from the silt carried by flood. You see it near the stone or near the tree. That which is exposed to 

the sun is yellowish or greenish and which is under the shade is white. They said: Messenger of Al-

lah! it seems as if you had been tending a flock in the jungle. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They will 

come forth like pearls with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of Paradise would recognise them 

(and say): Those are who have been set free by the Compassionate One. Who has admitted them into 

Paradise without any (good) deed that they did or any good that they sent in advance Then He would 

say: Enter the Paradise; whatever you see in it is yours. They would say: O Lord, Thou hast bestowed 

upon us (favours) which Thou didst not bestow upon anyone else in the world. He would say: There 

is with Me (a favour) for you better than this. They would say: O our Lord! which thing is better than 

this? He would say: It is My pleasure. I will never be angry with you after this

Book 001, Number 0353: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: We said: Messenger of Allah, shall we see 

our Lord? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing 

the sun on a cloudless day? We said: No. And the remaining part of the hadith has been narrated to 

the end like the hadith transmitted by Hafs b. Maisara with the addition of these words: Without the 

deed that they did or any good that they had sent before. It would be said to them: For you is whate-

ver you see (in it) and with it the like of it. Abu Sa'id said: I have come to know that the bridge would 

be thinner even than the hair and sharper than the sword; and in the hadith narrated by Laith these 

words are not found: They would say, O our Lord! Thou hast bestowed upon us (favours) which thou 

didst not bestow on anyone else in the world.

Book 001, Number 0354: 

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ja'far b. 'Aun, Hisham b. Sa'd, Zaid b. Aslam narrated the hadith as trans-

Mercy, and admit those condemned to Hell into the Fire (of Hell). He would then say: See, he whom 

you find having as much faith in his heart as a grain of mustard, bring him out. They will then be 

brought out burned and turned to charcoal, and would be cast into the river of life, and they would 

sprout aj does a seed in the silt carried away by flood. Have you not seen that it comes out yellow 

(fresh) and intertwined?

Book 001, Number 0356: 

This hadith is transmitted by 'Amr b. Yahya with the same chain of transmitters who narrated: 

They would be cast into the river which is called (the river of) life, and (both the narrators) did not 

doubt the hadith. The text transmitted by Khalid is: just as seeds sprout beside the flood water; and in 

the hadith of Wuhaib it is: Just as the seed sprouts in the silt or deposit left by flood.

Book 001, Number 0357: 

It is reported by Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The (perma-

nent) inhabitants of the Fire are those who are doomed to it, and verily they would neither die nor 

live in it (al-Qur'an, xx. 47; lxxxvii. 13). But the people whom the Fire would afflict (temporarily) on 

account of their sins, or so said (the narrator)" on account of their misdeeds," He would cause them 

to die till they would be turned into charcoal. Then they would be granted intercession and would be 

brought in groups and would be spread on the rivers of Paradise and then it would be said: O inha-

bitants of Paradise, pour water over them; then they would sprout forth like the sprouting of seed in 

the silt carried by flood. A man among the people said: (It appears) as if the Messenger of Allah lived 

in the steppe.

Book 001, Number 0358: 

Abu Nadra narrated it from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri who reported it from the Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) a similar (hadith) up to the words:" in the mud of the flood," and he did not mention (the 

words narrated) after it.

Book 001, Number 0359: 

Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I know 

the last of the inhabitants of Fire to be taken out therefrom, and the last of the inhabitants of Paradise 

to enter it. A man will come out of the Fire crawling. Then Allah, the Blessed and Exalted will say to 

him: Go and enter Paradise. So he would come to it and it would appear to him as if it were full. He 

would go back and say: O my Lord! I found it full. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would say to him: 

Go and enter Paradise. He would come and perceive as if it were full. He would return and say: O my 

Lord! I found it full. Allah would say to him: Go and enter Paradise, for there is for you the like of the 

world and ten times like it, or for you is ten times the like of this world. He (the narrator) said. He

(that man) would say: Art Thou making a fun of me? or Art Thou laughing at me. though Thou art 

the King? He (the narrator) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were visible. 

And it was said: That would be the lowest rank among the inhabitants of Paradise.

Book 001, Number 0360: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him said: I recognise the last of the inhabitants of Fire to be taken out thereof. A man will come 

out of it crawling. It will be said to him: Go and enter Paradise. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He would 

go there to enter Paradise, but would find persons who have already occupied all its apartments. It 

would be said to him: Do you recall the time when you were in it (in the Hell)? He would say: Yes. It 

would be said to him: Express any desire. And he would express the desire. It would be said to him: 

For thee is that which thou desireth and ten times the world (worldly resources). He (the Holy Pro-

phet) said: He would say: Art Thou making a fun of me, though Thou art the King? I saw the Messen-

ger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were visible.

Book 001, Number 0361: 

Ibn Mas'ud reported: Verily the Messenger of Allah said: The last to enter Paradise would be a man 

who would walk once and stumble once and be burnt by the Fire once. Then when he gets beyond it, 

he will turn to it and say: Blessed is He Who has saved me from thee. Allah has given me something 

He has not given to any one of those in earlier or later times. Then a tree would be raised up for him 

and he will say: O my Lord I bring me near this tree so that I may take shelter in its shade and drink 

of its water. Allah, the Exalted and Great, would say: O son of Adam, if I grant you this, you will ask 

Me for something else. He would say: No. my Lord. And he would promise Him that he would not ask 

for anything else. His Lord would excuse him because He sees what he cannot help desiring; so He 

would bring him near it, and he would take shelter in its shade and drink of its water. Afterwards a 

tree more beautiful than the first would be raised up before him and he would say: O my Lord! bring 

me near this tree in order that I may drink of its water and take shelter in its shade and I shall not 

ask Thee for anything else. He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam, if I bring you near it you may ask 

me for something else. He would promise Him that he would not ask for anything else. His Lord will 

excuse him because He would see something he cannot help desiring. So He would bring him near it 

and he would enjoy its shade and drink its water. Then a tree would be raised up for him at the gate 

of the Paradise, more beautiful than the first two. He would say: O my Lord! bring me near this (tree) 

so that I may enjoy its shade and drink from its water. I shall not ask Thee for anything else. He (Al-

lah) would say: O son of Adam! did you not promise Me that you would not ask Me anything else? 

He would say: Yes, my Lord, but I shall not ask Thee for anything else. His Lord would excuse him for 

He sees something the temptation of which he could not resist. He (Allah) would bring him near to it, 

and when He would bring him near it he would hear the voices of the inhabitants of the Paradise. He 

would say: O my Lord! admit me to it. He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam, what will bring an end 

158 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 1: THE BOOK OF FAITH (KITAB AL-IMAN)

to your requests to Me? Will it please you if I give you the whole world and a like one along with it? 

He will say: O my Lord! art Thou mocking at me, though Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Ibn 

Mas'ud laughed and asked (the hearers): Why don't you ask me what I am laughing at. They (then) 

said: Why do you laugh? He said: It is in this way that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) laughed. They (the companions of the Holy Prophet) asked: Why do you laugh. Messenger of 

Allah? He said: On account of the laugh of the Lord of the universe, when he ldesirer of Paradise) sai 

Thou mocking at me though Thou art the Lord of the worlds? He would say: I am not mocking at 

you, but I have power to do whatever I will.

Chapter 83: The lowest of the ranks in paradise 

Book 001, Number 0362: 

It is transmitted from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that, verily, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: Amongst the inhabitants of Paradise the lowest in rank will be the person whose face Allah 

would turn away from the Fire towards the Paradise, and make a shady tree appear before him. He 

would say: O my Lord! direct my steps to this tree so that I (should enjoy) its shade; and the rest of 

the hadith is like that narrated by Ibn Mas'ud, but he did not mention:" He (Allah) would say: O son 

of Adam! what will bring an end to your making requests to Me" to the end of the tradition. In it, he 

added: Allah will remind him: Ask such and such, and when his expectations would be realised, Al-

lah would say: That is for you, and ten times as much. He said that he would then enter his house 

and his two wives with large and dark eyes would enter after him. They will say: Praise be to Allah, 

Who has created you for us and us for you. He will say: No one has been given the like of what I 

have been given.

Book 001, Number 0363: 

It is reported on the authority of al-Mughira b. Shu'ba that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: Moses asked his Lord: Who amongst the inhabitants of Paradise is the lowest to 

rank? He (Allah) said: The person who would be admitted into Paradise last of all among those de-

serving of Paradise who are admitted to it. I would be said to him: Enter Paradise. He would gay: O 

my Lord! how (should I enter) while the people have settled in their apartments and taken the shares 

(portions)? It would be said to him: Would you be pleased if there be for you like the kingdom of a 

king amongst the kings of the world? He would say: I am pleased my Lord. He (Allah) would say: For 

you is that, and like that, and like that, and like that, and that. He would say at the fifth (point): I am 

well pleased. My Lord. He (Allah) would say: It is for you and, ten times like it, and for you is what 

your self desires and your eye enjoys. He would say: I am well pleased, my Lord. He (Moses) said: 

(Which is) the highest of their (inhabitants of Paradise) ranks? He (Allah) said: They are those whom 

I choose. I establish their honour with My own hand and then set a seal over it (and they would be

blessed with Bounties) which no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no human mind has perceived: 

and this is sub- stantiated by the Book of Allah, Exalted and Great:" So no soul knows what delight of 

the eye is hidden for them; a reward for what they did" (xxxii. 17).

Book 001, Number 0364: 

Sha'bi reported he had heard al-Mughira b. Shu'ba say on the pulpit that Moses (peace be upon 

him) had asked Allah, Exalted and Great, about the reward of the lowest of the inhabitants of Paradi-

se, and the remaining part of hadith is the same (as narrated) above.

Book 001, Number 0365: 

Abu Dharr reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I know the last of the 

inhabitants of Paradise to enter it and the last of the inhabitants of Hell to come out of it. He is a man 

who would be brought on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said: Present his minor sins to him, 

and withhold from him his serious Sins. Then the minor sins would be placed before him, and it 

would be said: On such and such a day you did so and so and on such and such a day you did so and 

so. He would say: Yes. It will not be possible for him to deny, while he would be afraid lest serious 

sins chould be presented before him. It would be said to him: In place of every evil deed you will 

have good deed He will say: My Lord! I have done things I do not see here. I indeed saw the Messen-

ger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed.

Book 001, Number 0366: 

This hadith is also narrated by another chain of narrators, i. e. Ibn Numair, Abu Mu'awiya, Waki', 

Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Abu Kuraib, A'mash.

Book 001, Number 0367: 

It is reported on the authority of Abu Zubair that he heard from Jabir b 'Abdullah, who was asked 

about the arrival (of people on the Day of Resurrection). He said. We would come on the Day of Res-

urrection like this, like this, and see. carefully. that which concerns" elevated people". He (the narra-

tor) said: Then the people would be summoned along with their idols whom they worshipped, one 

after another. Then our Lord would come to us and say: Whom are you waiting for? They would say: 

We are waiting for our Lord. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: (We are not sure) till we 

gaze at Thee, and He would manifest Himself to them smilingly, and would go along with them and 

they would follow Him; and every person, whether a hypocrite or a believer, would be endowed 

with a light, and there would be spikes and hooks on the bridge of the Hell, which would catch hold 

of those whom Allah willed. Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the belie-

vers would secure salvation. and the first group to achieve it would comprise seventy thousand men 

who would have the brightness of full moon on their faces, and they would not be called to account.

Then the people immediately following them would have their faces as the brightest stars in the hea-

ven. This is how (the groups would follow one after another). Then the stage of intercession would 

come, and they (who are permitted to intercede) would intercede, till he who had declared:" There is 

no god but Allah" and had in his heart virtue of the weight of a barley grain would come out of the 

Fire. They would be then brought in the courtyard of Paradise and the inhabitants of Paradise would 

begin to sprinkle water over them till they would sprout like the sprouting of a thing in flood water, 

and their burns would disappear. They would ask their Lord till they would be granted (the bounties) 

of the world and with it ten more besides it.

Book 001, Number 0368: 

Jabir reported that he had heard with his ears the Apostle (may peace be upon him) saying: Allah

Hammad b. Zaid, reported: I said to 'Amr b. Dinar: Did you hear Jabir b. 'Abdullah narrating from 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that Allah would bring out people from the Fire 

through intercession. He said: Yes.

Book 001, Number 0370: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah repotted: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Verily people 

would be brought out from the Fire, and they would be burnt except the exterior (surfaces, fronts) of 

their faces; and they would enter Paradise.

Book 001, Number 0371: 

Yazid al-Faqir said: This view of the Khwarij (i. e. those who commit major sins and would be 

eternally doomed to Hell) had obsessed me, and we set out in a large group intending to perform the 

hajj and then going to the people (for the propagation of the views of the Khwarij). He (the narrator) 

said: We happened to past by Medina and found there Jabir b. 'Abdullah sitting near a column nar-

rating to the people (the ahadith of) the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). When he mentioned 

the inhabitants of Hell, I said: O companion of the Messenger of Allah what is this that thou narra-

teth, whereas Allah sayeth:" Verily whomsoever Thou shall commit to the Fire, Thou indeed humilla-

teth him" (al-Qur'an, iii. 192) ; and All those who endeavoured to get out of that would be thrown 

back into it" (al-Qur'an, xxxi i. 20)? So what is it that you say? He said: Have you read the Qur'an? I 

said: Yes. He said: Have you heard about' the (exalted) position of Muhammad (may peace be upon 

him), i. e. to which Allah would raise, him? I said: Yes. He said: Verily the position of Muhammad 

(may peace be upon him) is that of great glory and that is by which Allah would bring out whorn-

soever He would wish to bring out. He then described the Path (the Bridge) and the passing of the

people over it, and said: I am afraid I may not have remembered (other things) but this much is still 

in my memory that people would come out of the Hell after having gone into it, and he said: They 

would come out of it as if they were the wood of the ebony tree. He (the narrator said: They would 

enter a river, one or the rivers of Paradise, and would bathe in it, and then come out as if they were 

(white like) paper. We then turned back and said: Woe be upon you! How can this old man tell a lie 

against the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? We turned back (from the views of the 

Khwarij), and by God every one of us abandoned this (band of Khwarij) except one man. A similar 

statement has been made by Abu Nu'aim.

Book 001, Number 0372: 

It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: Four persons would be brought out from the Fire and would be presented to Allah. One of 

them would turn (towards the He) ) ) and say: O my Lord, when Thou hast brought me out from it, 

do not throw me back into it, and Allah would rescue him from it.

Book 001, Number 0373: 

Anas b Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah would gather 

people on the Day of Resurrection and they would be concerned about it, and Ibn Ubaid said. They 

would get a Divine inspiration about it, and would say: If we could seek intercession with our Lord, 

we may be relieved from this predicament of ours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would come to 

Adam andsay, Thou art Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created thee with His own hand and 

breathed unto thee of His Spirit and commanded the angels and they prostrated before thee. So in-

tercede for us with thy Lords, that He may relieve us from this position of ours. He would say: I am 

not in a position to do this, and would recall his error, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of 

that; go to Noah the first messenger (after me) sent by Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So they 

would come to Noah (peace be upon him). He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, 

and recall his fault which he had committed, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that, 

(and would say): You better go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) whom Allah took for a friend. They 

would come to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and he would say: I am not in a position to do that for 

you, and would recall his fault that he had committed and would, therefore, fight shy of his Lord on 

that account (and would say): You better go to Moses (peace be upon him) with whom Allah conver-

sed and con- ferred Torah upon him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So they would come to Moses (pe-

ace be upon him) He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and would recall his fault 

that he had committed and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that (and would say): You bet-

ter go to Jesus, the Spirit of Allah and His word He would say: I am not in a position to do that for 

you; you better go to Muhammad (may peace be upon him), a servant whose former and later sins 

have been forgiven. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger or Allah (may peace be upon him) obser-

ved: So they would come to me and I would ask the permission of my Lord and it would be granted

to me, and when I would see Him, I would fall down in prostration, and He (Allah) would leave me 

thus as long as He would wish, and then it would be said: O Muhammad, raise your head, say and 

you would be heard; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. 

Then I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with the praise which my Lord would teach me. I 

shall then inter- cede, but a limit would be set for me I would bring them out from the Fire and 

make them enter Paradise (according to the limit). I shall return then ard fall down in pros- tration 

and Allah would leave me (in that position) as long as He would wish to leave me it would be said: 

Rise, O Muhammad, say and you would be heard; ask and it would be conferred; intercede and in-

tercession would be granted. I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with praise that He would 

teach me. I would theft intercede and a limit would be set for me. I would bring them out of the Fire 

(of Hell) and make them enter Paradise. He (the narrator) said: I do not remember whether he (the 

Holy Prophet) said at tLe third time or at the fourth time: O my Lord, none has been left in the Fire, 

but thise restrained by the Holy Qur'an, i e. those who were eternally doomed. Ibn Ubaid said in a

Ma'bad b. Hilal al 'Anazi reported: We went to Anas b. Malik through Thabit and reached there 

(his house) while he was offering the forenoon prayer. Thabit sought permission for us and we ente-

red, and he seated Thabit with him on his bedstead. He (Thabit) said to him (Anas b. Malik): O Abu 

Hamza (kunya of Anas b. Malik), your brothers from among the inhabitants of Basra ask you to nar-

rate to them the hadith of intercession. He said: Muhammad (may peace be upon him) narrated to 

us: When it would be the Day of Resurrection, some of the people would rush to one another in be-

wilderment. They would come to Adam and say: Intercede (with your Lord) for your progeny. He 

would say: I am not fit to do this, but go to Ibrabim (peace be upon him) for he is the Friend of Allah. 

They would come to Ibrahim, but he would say: I am not fit to do this, but go to Moses, for he is Al-

lah's Interlocutor. They would come to Moses, but he would say: I am not fit to do this, but you 

should go to Jesus, for he is the Spirit of Allah and His word. They would come to Jesus, and he would 

say, I am not fit to do this; you better go to Muhammad (may peace be upon him). They would come 

to me, and I would say: I am in a position to do that, I would go and ask the permission of my Lord 

and it would be granted to me. I would then stand before Him and would extol Him with praises 

which I am not able to do now, but with which Allah would inspire me, then I would fall in prostra-

tion and it would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise thy head, and say and it would be listened to; 

ask and it would be granted, intercede and it would be accepted. I shall say: My Lord, my people, my 

people It would be said: Go, and bring forth from it (Hell) him who has in his heart faith equal to the 

weight of a wheat grain or a barley seed. I would go and do that; then I would return to my Lord and 

extol Him with those praises (taught to me by Allah), then I would fall in prostration. It would be 

said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head, and say and it would be heard; ask and it would be gran-

ted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. So I would say: My people. my people. It would be 

said to me: Go and take out from it (Hell) him who has in his heart faith equal to the weight of a mu-

stard seed. I would go and do that. I would again return to my Lord and extol Him with those praises. 

I would then fall in prostration. It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raisevour head: say, and you 

would be listened to; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. I 

would say: My Lord, my people, my people. It would be said to me: Go, and bring out of the Fire him 

who has in his heart as much faith as the smallest, smallest, smallest grain of mustard seed. I would 

go and do that.

This is the hadith which Anas narrated to us. We went out of his (house) and when we reached 

the upper part of Jabban (graveyard) we said: Would that we meet Hasan and salute him and he was 

hiding in the house of Abu Khalifa. He (Ma'bad b. Hilal, the narrator) said: We went to him and

greeted him and we said: O Abu Sa'id, we come from your brother Abu Hamza (kunya of Anas), and 

we have never heard a hadith like this relating to intercession, which he has narrated to us. He said: 

Narrate it, we narrated the hadith. He said: Narrate it (still further). We said: He did not (narrate it) 

before us more than this. He said: He (Anas) had narrated it to us twenty years back, when he was 

strong and healthy. He has in fact missed something. I cannot make out whether the old man has 

forgotten or he has (intentionally) avoided to narrate it to you lest you should rely (absolutely) upon 

it (and abandon doing good deeds). We said to him: Relate that to us, and he laughed and said: There 

is haste in the nature of man. I did not make mention of it to you but for the fact that I wanted to 

narrate that to you (and added that the Holy Prophet said): I would then return to my Lord for the 

fourth time and extol Him with these praises. I would then fall in prostration. It would be said to me: 

O Muhammad, raise your head: say and it will be listened to; ask and it will be granted; intercede 

and intercession would be accepted. I would say: O my Lord, permit me regarding him who profes-

sed: There is no god but Allah. He (the Lord) would say: That is not for thee or that is not what lies 

with thee, but by My Honour, Glory, Greatness and Might, I would certainly take him out who pro-

fessed it: There is no god but Allah. He (the narrator, Ma'bad) said: I hear testimony to the fact that 

the hadith transmitted to us-by Hasan was heard by him from Anas b. Malik and I can see that he 

reported it twenty years back, when he was hale and hearty.

Book 001, Number 0378: 

Abu Huraira reported: Meat was one day brought to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) and a foreleg was offered to him, a part which he liked. He sliced with his teeth a piece out of it 

and said: I shall be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah 

would gather in one plain the earlier and the later (of the human race) on the Day of Resurrection. 

Then the voice of the proclaimer would be heard by all of them and the eyesight would penetrate 

through all of them and the sun would come near. People would then experience a degree of an-

guish, anxiety and agony which they shall not be able to bear and they shall not be able to stand. 

Some people would say to the others: Don you see in which trouble you are? Don't you see what 

(misfortune) has overtaken you? Why don't you find one who should intercede for you with your 

Lord? Some would say to the others: Go to Adam. And they would go to Adam and say: O Adam, thou 

art the father of mankind. Allah created thee by His own Hand and breathed in thee of His spirit and 

ordered the angels to prostrate before thee. Intercede for us with thy Lord Don't you see in what 

(trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Adam would say: Verily, my 

Lord is angry, to an extent to which He had never been angry before nor would He be angry after-

ward. Verily, He forbade me (to go near) that tree and I disobeyed Him. I am concerned with my own 

self. Go to someone else; go to Noah. They would come to Noah and would say: O Noah, thou art the 

first of the Messengers (sent) on the earth (after Adam), and Allah named thee as a" Grateful Servant," 

intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in what (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortu-

ne) has overtaken us? He would say: Verily, my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry be-

fore, and would never be angry afterwards. There had emanated a curse from me with which I cur-

sed my people. I am concerned with only myself, I am concerned only with myself; you better go to 

Ibrahim (peace be upon him). They would go to Ibrahim and say: Thou art the apostle of Allah and 

His Friend amongst the inhabitants of the earth; intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in 

which (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Ibrahim would say to 

them: Verily, my Lord is today angry as He had never been angry before and would never be angry 

afterwards. and (Ibrahim) would mention his lies (and then say): I am concerned only with myself, I 

am concerned only with myself. You better go to someone else: go to Moses. They would come to 

Moses (peace be upon him) and say: O Moses, thou art Allah's messenger, Allah blessed thee with His 

messengership and His conversation amongst people. Intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in 

what (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Moses (peace be upon 

him) would say to them: Verily. my Lord is angry as He had never been angry before and would ne-

ver be angry afterwards. I, in fact, killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. I am concer-

ned with myself, I am concerned with myself. You better go to Jesus (peace be upon him). They 

would come to Jesus and would say: O Jesus, thou art the messenger of Allah and thou conversed 

with people in the cradle, (thou art) His Word which I-Ie sent down upon Mary. and (thou art) the 

Spirit from Him; so intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see (the trouble) in which we are? Don't 

you see (the misfortune) that has overtaken us? Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: Verily, my 

Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before or would ever be angry afterwards. He men-

tioned no sin of his. (He simply said: ) I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself; you 

go to someone else: better go to Muhammad (may peace be upon him).

They would come to me and say: O Mahammad, thou art the messenger of Allah and the last of 

the apostles. Allah has pardoned thee all thy previous and later sins. Intercede for us with thy Lord; 

don't you see in which (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? I shall 

then set off and come below the Throne and fall down prostrate before my Lord; then Allah would 

reveal to me and inspire me with some of His Praises and Glorifications which He had not revealed 

to anyone before me. He would then say: Muhammad, raise thy head; ask and it would be granted; 

intercede and intercession would be accepted I would then raise my head and say: O my Lord, my 

people, my people. It would be said: O Muhammad, bring in by the right gate of Paradise those of 

your people who would have no account to render. They would share with the people some other 

door besides this door. The Holy Prophet then said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, 

verify the distance between two door leaves of the Paradise is as great as between Mecca and Hajar, 

or as between Mecca and Busra.

Book 001, Number 0379: 

It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that there was placed before the Messenger of Allah 

a cup of soft bread, soup and meat. He took part of the foreleg which he liked most. He sliced (with 

his teeth) a slice (out of that) and said: I would be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. 

He then sliced (that meat) for the second time and said: I am the leader of mankind on the Day of Re-

don't you say: How would that be? They said: How would be it, Messenger of Allah? He said: People 

would stand before the Lord of the worlds. And the rest of the hadith was narrated like the one 

transmitted by Abu Hayyan, on the authority of Abu Zur'a, and in the story of Ibrahim, this addition 

was made. He said and made mention of his words with regard to the star: This is my Lord. And his 

words with regard to their gods: But the big among them has done that. And his words: I am ailing. 

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the distance between 

two leaves of the door from their supporting frames is as the distance between Mecca and Hajar or 

Hajar and Mecca. I do not remember how he said it (whether Mecca and Hajar or Hajar and Mecca).

Book 001, Number 0380: 

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira and Hudhaifa that the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) said: Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would gather people. The believers would 

stand till the Paradise would be brought near them. They would come to Adam and say: O our father, 

open for us the Paradise. He would say: What turned ye out from the Paradise was the sin of your fa-

ther Adam. I am not in a position to do that; better go to my son Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah. He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: He (Ibrahim) would say: I am not in a position to do that. Verily I had been the 

Friend (of Allah) from beyond, beyond; you better approach Moses (peace be upon him) with whom 

Allah conversed. They would come to Moses (peace be upon him), but he would say: I am not in a 

position to do that; you better go to Jesus, the Word of Allah and His Spirit. Jesus (peace be upon him) 

would say: I am not in a position to do that. So they would come to Mubammad (may peace be upon 

him). He would then be permitted (to open the door of Paradise). Trust worthiness and kinship 

would be despatched, and these would stand on the right and left of the Path and the first of you 

would pass with (the swiftness) of lightning. He (the narrator) said: I said, O thou who art far dearer 

to me than my father and my mother I which thing is like the passing of lightning? He said: Have 

you not seen lightning, how it passes and then comes back within the twinkling of an eye? Then 

(they would pass) like the passing of the wind, then like the passing of a bird, and the hastening of 

persons would be according to their deeds, and your Apostle would be standing on the Path saying: 

Save, O my Lord, save. (The people would go on passing) till the deeds of the servants would be fai-

ling in strength, till a man would come who would find it hard to go along (that Path) but crawlin-

gly. He (the narrator) said: And on the sides of the Path hooks would be suspended ready to catch 

anyone whom these would be required (to catch). There would be those who would somehow or 

other succeed in trasversing that Path and some would be piled up in Hell. By Him in Whose Hand is 

the life of Abu Huraira it would take one seventy years to fathom the depth of Hell.

saw a star shooting last night? I said: It was I; then I said: I was in fact not (busy) in prayer, but was 

stung by a scorpion (and that is the reason why I was awake and had a glimpse of the shooting star). 

He said: Then what did you do? I said: I practised charm. He said: What urged you to do this? I said: 

(I did this according to the implied suggestion) of the hadith which al-Shu'ba narrated. He said: 

What did al-Shu'ba narrate to you? I said: Buraida b. Husaib al-Aslami narrated to us. The charm is 

of no avail except in case of the (evil influence) of an eye or the sting of a scorpion. He said: He who 

acted according to what he had heard (from the Holy Prophet) acted rightly, but Ibn 'Abbas narrated 

to us from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) that he said: There were brought before me 

the peoples and I saw an apostle and a small group (of his followers) along with him, another (apost-

le) and one or two persons (along with him) and (still another) apostle having no one with him. 

When a very large group was brought to me I conceived as if it were my Ummah. Then it was said to 

me: It is Moses and his people. You should look at the horizon, and I saw a very huge group. It was 

again said to me: See the other side of the horizon, and there was (also) a very huge group. It was 

said to me: This is your Ummah, and amongst them there were seventy thousand persons who would 

be made to enter Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. He 

then stood up and went to his house. Then the people began to talk about the people who would be 

admitted to Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. Some of 

them said: They may be those who (have had the good fortune of living) in the company of the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some of them said: They be those who were born in Is-

lam and did not associate anything with Allah. Some people mentioned other things. Thereupon 

came forth the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) before them and he said: What was that 

which you were talking about? They informed him. He said: They are those persons who neither 

practise charm, nor ask others to practise it, nor do they take omens, and repose their trust in their 

Lord. Upon this 'Ukkasha b. Mihsan stood up and said: Supplicate for me that He should make me

Epilogue 

Before we close the" Kitab-ul-Iman," it seems necessary to bring a few facts before our readers. 

This book deals with the beliefs, i. e. those unseen realities which we have a strong yearning to com-

prehend, but which elude the grasp of our senses. 

Every person, who is endowed with consciousness, is instinctively impelled to know whence he 

came and where he would return. What would become of him after crossing the bar of life? Is the

short span of this wordly life the culmination of all his hopes and desires and nothing remains after 

it? These are the questions which agitate the mind of every man, whether he is a believer or a non-

believer, whether he is a monotheist or a polytheist or an atheist. We cannot silence the echoes of 

our souls by simply saying that nothing can be said with certainty about them. The mind yearns for 

definite and satisfactory answers to all of them. That is what is embedded in our very nature and so 

long as we are human beings we cannot afford to ignore them. We approach scientists for the soluti-

on of these spiritual problems of ours which have a direct bearing on our social life, but scientists 

have no definite answers to give since they are concerned only with observable facts, that is to say, 

the optically present source of sensation, which forms only a fraction of man's life and the vast sea 

of" unseen world" lies hidden before them. That is the reason why even a scientist has to fall back 

upon chance-a very imortant admission as to the limits of the so-called scientific knowledge and the 

possibility of another knowledge unknown to science and altogether different from that with the 

help of which we observe physical phenomena and their laws. 

Moreover, the scientific method cannot help us solve the problem of" whence" and" whither". The-

re is always an urge in our hearts to peep across this life hemmed in by space and time and find out 

our ultimate destiny. Since science deals with" actual," with what is here and now, particularly what 

can be comprehended with the helpof senses, there is inherent in science a natural tendency to assu-

re that man, too, like inanimate matter, is a bubble that bursts and a vision that fades. If we take this 

view of man, which is the inevitable conclusion of the so-called" scientific inquiry," the whole of hu-

man life in which man plays such a prominent role becomes a meaningless riddle, for he is denied 

the existence of spiritual yearning in him which is nothing but a sort of cruel joke with man." Life," 

says Dr Muhammad Iqbal (Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, pp 50-1)," with its intense 

feeling of spontaneity constitutes a centre of indetermination, and thus falls outside, the domain of 

necessity... The biologist who seeks a mechanical explanation of life is led to do so because he confi-

nes his study to the lower forms of life whose behaviour discloses resemblances to mechanical acti-

on. If he studies life as manifested in himself, i. e., his own mind freely choosing, rejecting, reflecting, 

surveying the past and the present, and dynarnically imagining the future. he is sure to be convinced 

of the inadequacy of his mechancal concepts." 

The observable facts or, in other words, the physical entities form only a part of the Reality. On 

how to know and comprehend the other parts which concern us more intimately than the physical 

entities. science has nothing definite to say except a meaningful silence which betrays its natural li-

mitation in solving these vital problems of life. 

Psychology, too, is inherently incompetent to comprehend the unseen Realities of the universe. 

Life, as we all know. is a great mystery everrin its biological aspects; how mysterious it is in its spiri-

tual and moral aspects, we cannot imagine. Psychology has been-able to grope in the darkness of 

unconscious and, ub-conscious chambers and has not been able to bring into light the secrets of the 

human soul." Psychology," says Waiter Leibrecht (Religion and Culture, p. 33)," can show us what 

man is not. It cannot tell us what man, each one of us, is. The legitimate aim of psychology is the ne-

gative, the removal of distortions and illusions, but not the positive, the full and complete knowledge 

of human being." The fact is that human knowledge and intellect, in spite of their boastful claims, are 

by nature so much handicapped that they, unaided by revelation, cannot in any way comprehend 

the unseen Realities. What the intellect at the most can do is to transform the sense-data into con-

ceptual forms, but it has to depend ultimately upon experience and is, therefore, subjected to the 

same limitations to which the knowledge of pysical sciences is subjected." The intellect," say Ibn 

Khaldun, is a correct scale. Its indications are completely certain and in no way wrong. However, the 

intellect should not be used to weigh such matters as the oneness of God, the Hereafter, the truth of 

prophecy, the real character of Divine Attributes, or anything else that lies beyond the level of the in-

tellect. That would mean to aspire for the impossible. One might compare it with a man who sees a 

scale in which gold is being weighed, and wants to weigh mountains in it. This (the fact that it is im-

possible) does not prove that the indications of the scale are not true (when it is used for its proper 

purpose). However, there is a limit at which intellect must stop. It cannot go beyond its own level" 

(The Muqaddimah, translated by Franz Rosenthal, Vol. III. p. 38). What a man in the cold regions of 

an arid intellectualism can, at his best, infer is only the existence of a Prime Cause, but to far as His 

Attributes, His will, His behaviour with humanity and His Creation, and our relation with Him are 

concerned. Intellect has nothing positive to say. It is at this stage that man instinctively feels the need 

of an agency which shoure provide him authentic information about unseen rmuties of life. This 

agencv is known as Prophethoud. The Great Lord, Who has provided man with materiaf resources 

for the satisfaction of his macerial needs, has also made suitable arrangements to acquaint us fully 

with the Unseen Realities which our souls yearn to know. This knowledge of the Unseen is vouchsa-

fed to us through His trusted Messengers (prophets). This is an immense savour from our Lord, im-

measurably more valuable then the material resources for, without it, human souls would have suf-

fered the pangs of privation and would have ultimately died. The Qur'an says: 

All praise is due to Allah. Who guided us to this. And we would not have found the way if Allah 

had not guided us. Certainly the Messengers of our Lord brought the Truth (vii. 43). 

Just as the information of the Holy Prophet pertaining to our worldly life is perfectly correct jud-

ged by any standard, in the same way his revelations concerning the Unseen. e. g. the Day of Resur-

rection, Paradise and Hell, will also be perfectly true. because he As Amin. the Truthful. We should, 

however, bear in mind that since we are living in a world of senses it is, therefore, through sensory 

experiences that we comprehend it. A man's mind is so much hemmed in by space and time and his 

vision is so much limited by the material aspects of his life that it is only through material concepts 

that his mind is led to the knowledge of the Unseen. That is the reason why one can easily find fre-

quent use of metaphors and similes in the language of the Holy Prophet as be explained the Unseen 

Realities of existence. These are not myths, but the Great undeniable Truths which our souls yearn to 

know, affirm and believe. but which our own intelligence fails to comprehend.

BOOK 02: THE BOOK OF PURIFICATION (KITAB AL-TAHARAH)

Introduction 

We have read in the first Book that the love of Allah is the highest aim of a true believer. It is for 

the achievement of this single end that he affirms his faith in Him by renouncing all other types of 

godhood. 

The love of God is not something inert or lifeless; it is dynamic in the sense that it calls for a com-

plete change in the life of man: change in his thoughts and ideas and change in his conduct and be-

haviour. One who claims to be a believer in Allah has to make a good deal of effort with a view to 

pleasing his: lord. He has to purify his soul from all evil thoughts and fancies so that the love of God 

should reside in it. Unless the soul is purged of all impurities one cannot achieve salvation. This is 

known as Tahdrah in Islam, and it is the foundation-stone of Imin. This high objective of the purifi-

cation of the soul requires intentional and deliberate efforts and a good deal of sacrifice on the part 

of man, and the most elementary stage in this sacred path is the cleanliness of body. 

By enjoining cleanliness of body upon man Islam awakens him to the realisation of the fact that 

when impurities on the body of a man produce such unhealtby effects on his physical being and 

corrode his mental health, how miserable his life would be when his soul is polluted with impurities. 

The process of the purification of the soul should, therefore, start with the purification of the body. 

Chapter 1: Merit of wudu' 

Book 002, Number 0432: 

Abu Malik at-Ash'ari reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Cleanliness 

is half of faith and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fills the scale, and Subhan Allah (Glory be to 

Allah) and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fill upwhat is between the heavens and the earth, 

and prayer is a light, and charity is proof (of one's faith) and endurance is a brightness and the Holy 

Qur'an is a proof on your behalf or against you. All men go out early in the morning and sell them-

selves, thereby setting themselves free or destroying themselves.

Chapter 2: Purification is essential for prayer 

Book 002, Number 0433: 

Mus'ab b. Sa'd reported: 'Abdullah son of Umar came to Ibn'Amir in order to inquire after his he-

alth as he was ailing. He said Ibn 'Umar, why don't you prayto Allah for me? He said: I heard of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: Neither the prayer is accepted without parification 

nor is charity accepted out of the ill-gotten (wealth), and thou wert the (governor) of Basra.

right foot up to the ankle three times, then washed his left foot like that, and then said: I saw the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) perform ablution like this ablution of mine. Then the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who performs ablution like this ablution of 

mine and then stood up (for prayer) and offered two rak'ahs of prayer without allowing his thoughts 

to be distracted, all his previous sins are expiated. Ibn Shihab said: Our scholars remarked: This is the 

most complete of the ablutions perfomed for prayer.

ace be upon him) about a woman who sees in a dream what a man sees (sexual dream). The Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon bi m) said: In case a woman sees that, she must take a bath. Umm 

Sulaim said: I was bashful on account of that and said: Does it happen? Upon this the Apostle of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him) said: Yes (it does happen), otherwise how can (a child) resemble her?

the resemblance comes from the one whose genes prevail or dominate.

sees the liquid (vaginal secretion). Umm Salama said: Messenger of Allah, does a woman have sexual 

dream? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Let your hand be covered with dust, in what way does her child 

resemble her?

with dust and injured. She narrated: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Leave 

her alone. In what way does the child resemble her but for the fact that when the genes contributed 

by woman prevail upon those of man, the child resembles the maternal family, and when the genes

and said: Peace be upon you, O Muhammad. I pushed him backwith a push that he was going to fall. 

Upon this he said: Why do you push me? I said: Why don't you say: O Messenger of Allah? The Jew 

said: We call him by the name by which he was named by his family. The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said: My name is Muhammad with which I was named by my family. The Jew 

said: I have come to ask you (something). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 

Should that thing be of any benefit to you, if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I will lend my ears to it. 

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) drew a line with the help of the stick that he had 

with him and then said: Ask (whatever you like). Thereupon the Jew said: Where would the human 

beings be on the Daywhen the earth would change into another earth and the heavens too (would 

change into other heavens)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: They would be 

in darkness beside the Bridge. He (the Jew) again said: Who amongst people would be the first to 

cross (this bridge).? He said: They would be the poor amongst the refugees. The Jew said: What 

would constitute their breakfast when they would enter Paradise? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: A 

caul of the fish-liver. He (the Jew) said. What would be their food alter this? He (the Holy Prophet) 

said: A bullockwhich was fed in the different quarters of Paradise would be slaughtered for them. He 

(the Jew) said: What would be their drink? He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would be given drink 

from the fountain which is named" Salsabil". He (the Jew) said: I have come to ask you about a thing 

which no one amongst the people on the earth knows except an apostle or one or two men besides

him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Would it benefit you if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I would 

lend ears to that. He then said: I have come to ask you about the child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: 

The reproductive substance of man is white and that of woman (i. e. ovum central portion) yellow, 

and when they have sexual intercourse and the male's substance (chromosomes and genes) prevails 

upon the female's substance (chromosomes and genes), it is the male child that is created by Allah's 

Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a 

female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you 

are an Apostle. He then returned and went away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: He asked me about such and such things of which I have had no knowledge till Allah gave me 

that.

'Uyaina gave a demonstration by covering his face (as the Holy Prophet had done). 'A'isha reported: I

rously till it reaches the roots of the hair. Then she should pour water on it. Afterwards she should 

take a piece of cotton smeared with musk and cleanse herself with it. Asma' said: How should she 

cleanse herself with the help of that? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) observed: Praise be to Allah, 

she should cleanse herself. 'A'isha said in a subdued tone that she should apply it to the trace of 

blood. She (Asma) then further asked about bathing after sexual intercourse. He (the Holy Prophet) 

said: She should take water and cleanse herself well or complete the ablution and then (pour water) 

on her head and rub it till it reaches the roots of the hair (of her) head and then pour water on her.

lah (may peace be upon him) said: This is not menstruation, but (blood from) a vein: so bathe your-

self and offer prayer. 'A'isha said: She took a bath in the wash-tub placed in the apartment of her sis-

ter Zainab b. Jahsh, till the redness of the blood came over the water. Ibn Shihab said: I narrated it to

Chapter 27: Tayammum 

Book 003, Number 0714: 

'A'isha reported: We went with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) on one of his jour-

neys and when we reached the place Baida' or Dhat al-jaish, my necklace was broken (and fell so-

mewhere). The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) along with other people stayed there 

for searching it. There was neither any water at that place nor was there any water with them (the 

Companions of the Holy Prophet). Some persons came to my father Abu Bakr and said: Do you see 

what 'A'isha has done? She has detained the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and per-

sons accompanying him, and there is neither any water here or with them. So Abu Bakr came there 

and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He 

(Abu Bakr) said: You have detained the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and other per-

sons and there is neither water here nor with them. She ('A'isha) said: Abu Bakr scolded me and utte-

red what Allah wanted him to utter and nudged my hips with his hand. And there was nothing to 

prevent me from stirring but for the fact that the messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was 

lying upon my thigh. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) slept till it was dawn at a 

waterless place. So Allah revealed the verses pertaining to tayammum and they (the Holy Prophet 

and his Companions) performed tayammum. Usaid b. al-Hudair who was one of the leaders said: 

This is not the first of your blessings,0 Family to Abu Bakr. 'A'isha said: We made the came) stand 

which was my mount and found the necklace under it.

Book 003, Number 0715: 

'A'isha reported she had borrowed from Asma' (her sister) a necklace and it was lost. The Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent men to search for it. As it was the time for prayer, they 

offered prayer without ablution (as water was not available there). When they came to the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him), they made a complaint about it, and the verses pertaining to 

tayammum were revealed. Upon this Usaid b. Hadair said (to 'A'isha): May Allah grant you a good 

reward! Never has been there an occasion when you were beset with difficulty and Allah did not 

make you come out of that and made it an occasion of blessing for the Muslims.

he experiences a seminal emission or has sexual intercourse but does not find water for a month? 

'Abdullah said: He should not perform tayammum even if he does not find water for a month. 'Ab-

sibility that they would perform tayammum with dust on finding water very cold for themselves. 

Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of 'Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and 

rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It would have been 

enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands once and wiped his right hand 

with the help of his left hand and the exterior of his palms and his face. 'Abdullah said: Didn't you 

see that Umar was not fully satisfied with the words of 'Ammar only?

military detachment and we had had a seminal emission and did not find water (for taking bath) and 

you did not say prayer, but as for myself I rolled in dust and said prayer, and (when it was mentio-

BOOK 04: THE BOOK OF PRAYERS (KITAB AL-SALAT)

Introduction 

Prayer is the soul of religion. Where there is no prayer, there can be no purification of the soul. 

The non-praying man is rightly considered to be a soulless man. Take prayer out of the world, and it 

is all over with religion because it is with prayer that man has the consciousness of God and selfless 

love for humanity and inner sense of piety. Prayer is, therefore, the first, the highest, and the most 

solemn phenomenon and manifestation of religion. 

The way in which prayer is offered and the words which are recited in it explain the true nature 

of religion of which it is the expression of man's contact with the Lord. 

Prayer in Islam gives in a nutshell the teachings of Islam. The very first thing which comes into 

prominence in Islamic prayer is that it is accompanied by bodily movements. It implies that Islam 

lifts not only the soul to the spiritual height, but also illuminates the body of man with the light of 

God-consciousness. It aims at purifying both body and soul, for it finds no cleavage between them. 

Islam does not regard body and soul as two different entities opposed to each other, or body as the 

prison of the soul from which It yearns to secure freedom in order to soar to heavenly heights." The 

soul is an organ of the body which exploits it for physiological purposes, or body is an instrument of 

the soul" (Iqbal, Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, p 105), and thus both need spiritual 

enlightenment. 

Secondly, Islamic prayer does not aim at such a spiritual contact with God in which the world and 

self are absolutely denied, in which human personality is dissolved, disappears and is absorbed in the 

Infinite Lord. Islam does not favour such a meditation and absorption in which man ceases to be 

conscious of his own self and feels himself to be perfectly identified with the Infinite, and claims in a 

mood of ecstasy: My" I" has become God, or rather he is God. Islam wants to inculcate the conscious-

ness of the indwelling of the light of God in body and soul but does allow him to transport himself in 

the realm of lnfinity. It impresses upon his mind that he is the humble servant of the Great and Glo-

rious Lord and his spiritual development and religious piety lies in sincere and willing obedience to 

Allah. The very first step towards the achievement of this objective is that man should have a clear 

consciousness of his own finiteness and Infiniteness of the Lord, and clearly visualise and feel that he 

is created as a human being by the Creator and Master of the universe, and he cannot, therefore, be-

come demi-god or god. His success lies in proving himself by his outlook and behaviour that he is 

the true and loyal servant of his Great Master. Islamic prayer is, therefore, the symbol of humble re-

verence before the Majesty of the Glorious Lord.

Jews. Umar said: Why may not a be appointed who should call (people) to prayer? The Messenger of

that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad Is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Mu-

said: I have divided the prayer into two halves between Me and My servant, and My servant will re-

ceive what he asks. When the servant says: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe, Allah the

with having observed the prayer without the recitation (of al-Fatiha). So said Abu Huraira: (The 

prayer in which) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) recited in a loud voice, we also 

recited that loudly for you (and the prayer in which) he recited inwardly we also recited inwardly 

for you (to give you a practical example of the prayer of the Holy Prophet).

you. A person said to him: If I add nothing to the (recitation) of the Umm al Qur'an (Surat al-Fatiha), 

would it make the prayer incomplete? He (AbuHuraira) said: If you add to that (if you recite some of 

verses of the Qur'an along with Surat at-Fatiha) that is better for you. But if you are contented with it 

(Surat al-Fatiha) only, it is sufficient for you.

inwardly for you. And he who recites Umm al-Qur'an, it is enough for him (to complete the prayer), 

and he who adds to it (recites some other verses of the Holy Qur'an along with Surat al-Fatiha), it is 

preferable for him.

Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered the mosque and

his salutation and said: Go back and pray, for you have not offered the prayer. He again prayed as he 

had prayed before, and came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon. him) and saluted him. The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned the salutation and said: Go back and say 

prayer, for you have not offered the prayer. This (act of repeating the prayer) was done three times. 

Upon this the person said: By Him Who hast sent you with Truth, whatever better I can do than this, 

please teach me. He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you get up to pray, recite takbir, and then recite 

whatever you conveniently can from the Qur'an, then bow down and remain quietly in that position, 

then raise your- self and stand erect; then prostrate yourself and remain quietly in that attitude; then 

raise yourself and sit quietly; and do that throughout all your prayers.

my insistence upon it was not due to the fact that I entertained any apprehension in my mind that 

the people would not love the man who would occupy his (Prophet's) place (i. e. who would be ap-

pointed as his caliph) and I feared that the people would be superstitious about one who would oc-

cupy his place. I, therefore, desired that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) should lea-

anyone else to lead the prayer. By Allah, there is nothing disturbing in it for me but the idea that the 

people may not takeevil omen with regard to one who is the first to occupy the place of the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I tried to dissuade him (the Holy Prophet) twice or thrice

when ]be would stand at your place (he would be so overwhelmed by feelings) that he would not be 

able to make the people hear anything (his recitation would not be audible to the followers in pray-

er). You should better order Umar (to lead the prayer). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ask Abu Bakr to 

lead people in- prayer. She ('A'isha) said: I asked Hafsa to (convey) my impression to him (the Holy 

Prophet) that Abu Bakr was a tenderhearted man, so when he would stand at his place, he would not 

be able to make the people bear anything. He better order Umar. Hafsa conveyed this (message of 

Hadrat 'A'isha) to him (the Holy Prophet). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 

(You are behaving) as if you are the females who had gathered around Yusuf. Order Abd Bakr to 

lead the people in prayer. She ('A'isha) reported: So Abu Bakr was ordered to lead the people in pray-

er. As the prayer began, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) felt some relief; he got up 

and moved supported by two persons and his feet dragged on earth (due to excessive weakness). 

'A'isha reported: As he (the Holy Prophet) entered the mosque. Abu Bakr perceived his (arrival). He 

was about to with. draw, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) by the gesture (of This 

hand) told him to keep standing at his place. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came 

and seated himself on the left side of Abu Bakr. She ('A'isha) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may

Qur'an. And when the polytheists heard that, they reviled the Qur'an and Him Who revealed it and

not thy prayer so loudly that the polytheists may hear thy recitation and (recite it) not so low that it

that time) obstructions between satans and the news from the Heaven, and there were flung flames 

upon them. So satan went back to their people and they said: What has happened to you? They said: 

There have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. And there have

showed us their traces and traces of their embers. They (the Jinn) asked him (the Holy Prophet) about 

their provision and he said: Every bone on which the name of Allah is recited is your provision. The 

time it will fall in your hand it would be covered with flesh, and the dung of (the camels) is fodder

Book 004, Number 1068: 

Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to Medina and 

stayed in the upper part of Medina for fourteen nights with a tribe called Banu 'Amr b 'Auf. He then 

sent for the chiefs of Banu al-Najir, and they came with swords around their inecks. He (the narra-

tor) said: I perceive as if I am seeing the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on his ride 

with Abu Bakr behind him and the chiefs of Banu al-Najjar around him till he alighted in the cour-

tyard of Abu Ayyub. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said 

prayer when the time came for prayer, and he prayed in the fold of goats and sheep. He then ordered 

mosques to be built and sent for the chiefs of Banu al-Najjar, and they came (to him). He (the Holy 

Prophet) said to them: O Banu al-Najjar, sell these lands of yours to me. They said: No, by Allah. we 

would not demand their price, but (reward) from the Lord. Anas said: There (in these lands) were 

trees and graves of the polytheists, and ruins. The Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) or-

dered that the trees should be cut, and the graves should be dug out, and the ruins should be levelled. 

The trees (were thus) placed in rows towards the qibla and the stones were set on both sides of the 

door, and (while building the mosque) they (the Companions) sang rajaz verses along with the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him):

O Allah: there is no good but the good of the next world, So help the Ansar and the Muhajirin.

mode one of us stand on his right hand and the other on his left side. When we bowed, we placed 

our hands on our knees. He struck our hands and put his hands together, palm to palm, then put 

them between his thighs. When he completed the prayer he said. There would soon come your 

Amirs, who would defer prayers from their appointed time and would make such delay that a little 

time is left before sunset. So when you see them doing so, say prayer at its appointed time and then 

say prayer along with them as (Nafl), and when you are three, pray together (standing in one row), 

and when you are more than three, appoint one amongst you as your Imam. And when any one of

declare that neither before him nor after him have I seen a leader who gave better instruction than 

he for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom). I swear that he did not scold, beat or 

revile me but said: Talking to persons is not fitting during the prayer, for it consists of glorifying Al-

lah, declaring his Greatness. and recitation of the Qur'an or words to that effect. I said: Messenger of 

Allah. I was till recently a pagan, but Allah has brought Islam to us; among us there are men who 

have recourse to Kahins. He said, Do not have recourse to them. I said. There are men who take 

omens. That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn their way (from freedom 

of action). I said: Among us there are men who draw lines. He said: There was a prophet who drew 

lines, so if they do it as they did, that is allowable. I had a maid-servant who tended goats by the side 

of Uhud and Jawwaniya. One day I happened to pass that way and found that a wolf had carried a 

goat from her flock. I am after all a man from the posterity of Adam. I felt sorry as they (human 

beings) feel sorry. So I slapped her. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and 

felt (this act of mine) as something grievous I said: Messenger of Allah, should I not grant her free-

dom? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Bring her to me. So I brought her to him. He said to her: Where is

high, delaying it beyond the time he had previously observed it. He observed the evening prayer be-

fore the twilight had vanished; he observed the night prayer when a third of the night had passed;

Book 004, Number 1384: 

Mahmud b. al-Rabi' reported that 'Ibn b. Malik, who was one of the Companions of the Apostle of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) and who participated in the (Battle of) Badr and was among the An-

sar (of Medina), told that he came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: 

Messenger of Allah, I have lost my eyesight and I lead my people in prayer. When there is a down-

pour there is then a current (of water) in the valley that stands between me and them and I find it 

impossible to go to their mosque and lead them in prayer. Messenger of Allah, I earnestly beg of you 

that you should come and observe prayer at a place of worship (in my house) so that I should then 

use it as a place of worship. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Well, it God so 

wills. I would soon do so. 'Itban said: On the following day when the day dawned, the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace he upon him) came along with Abu Bakr at-Siddiq, and the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) asked permission (to get into the house). I gave him the permission, and be 

did not sit after entering the house, when he said: At what place in your house you desire me to say 

prayer? I ('Itban b. Malik) said: I pointed to a corner in the house, The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) stood (at that place for prayer) and pronounced Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Grea-

test) (as an expression for the commencement of prayer). We too stood behind him, and he said two 

rak'ahs and then pronounced salutation (marking the end of the prayer). We detained him (the Holy 

Prophet) for the meat curry we had prepared for, him. The people of the neighbouring houses came 

and thus there was a good gathering in (our house). One of them said: Where is Malik b. Dukhshun? 

Upon this one of them remarked: He is a hypocrite; he does not love Allah and His Messenger. The-

reupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not say so about him. Don't you see

nation and wellwishing for hypocrites only. Upon this the Messenger of Allah' (may peace be upon 

him) again said: Verily Allah has forbidden the Fire for one who says: There is no god but Allah, the-

reby seeking Allah's pleasure. Ibn Shihab said: I asked Husain b. Muhammad al-Ansar (he was one of

or Dukhaishin, and also made this addition that Mahmud said: I narrated this ver hadith to many 

people and among them was Abu Ayyub al-Ansari who said: I cannot think that the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) could have said so as you say. He (the narrator) said: I took an oath 

that if I ever go to 'Itban. I would ask him about it. So I went to him and found him to be a very aged 

man, having lost his eyesight, but he was the Imam of the people. I sat by his side and asked about 

this hadith and he narrated it In the same way as he had narrated it for the first time. Then so many 

other obligatory acts and commands were revealed which we see having been completed. So he who 

wants that he should not be deceived would not be deceived.

said: Stand up so that I should observe prayer (in order to bless) you Anas b. Malik said: I stood up on 

a mat (belonging to us) which had turned dark on account of its long use. I sprinkled water over it 

(in order to soften it), and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood upon it, and I and 

an orphan formed a row behind him (the Holy Prophet) and the old woman was behind us, and the

He led us in prayer. A person said to Thabit: Where stood Anas with him (the Holy Prophet)? He rep-

lied: He was on the right side. He then blessed us, the members of the household with every good of 

this world and of the Hereafter. My mother said: Messenger of Allah (and then, pointing towards 

Anas, said), here is your little servant, invoke the blessing of Allah upon him too. He then blessed me

alth, and his children and make (them the source of) blessing for him.

congregation is more valuable than twenty degrees and some above them as compared with his

mosque, and he is impelled (to do so) only by (the love of congregational) prayer, he has no other

ving a sin remitted for it, till he enters the mosque, and when he is busy in prayer after having ente-

red the mosque. the angels continue to invoke blessing on him as long as he is in his place of wor-

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions slept. When the time for dawn 

approached Bilal leaned against his camel facing the direction from which the dawn would appear 

but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning against his camel, and neither the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) nor Bilal, nor anyone else among his Companions got up, till the sun 

shone on them. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first of them to awake and,

being startled, he called to Bilal who said: Messenger of Allah I may my father and mother be offered 

as ransom for thee, the same thing overpowered me which overpowered you. He (the Holy Prophet, 

then) said: Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance. The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) then performed ablution and gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the Iqama 

and then led them in the morning prayer. When he finished the prayer he said: When anyone for-

gets the prayer, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said:" And observe the 

prayer for remembrance of Me" (Qur'an. xx. 14). Yunus said: Ibn Shilab used to recite it like this:" 

(And observe the prayer) for remembrance."

Book 004, Number 1449: 

Abu Huraira reported: We stopped for rest along with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon

that everybody should take hold of his camel's nosestring (get out of this ground) for it was the place 

where devil had visited us. We did accordingly. He then called for water and performed ablution 

and then performed two prostrations. Ya'qub said: Then he prayed (performed) two prostrations. 

then takbir was pronounced for prayer and then he offered the morning prayer (in congregation).

Book 004, Number 1450: 

Abu Qatida reported: The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) addressed us and said: You 

would travel In the evening and the might till (God willing) you would come in the morning to a 

place of water. So the people travelled (self absorbed) without paying any heed to one another, and 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also travelled till It was midnight. I was by his side. 

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his ca-

mel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him till he sat poised on his ride. He 

went on travelling till a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his 

camel. I supported him without awaking him till he sat" bed on his ride. and then travelled till it was 

near dawn. He (again) leaned which was far more inclined than the two earlier leanings and he was 

about to fall down. So I came to him and supported him and he lifted his head and said; Who is this? 

I said: it is Abu Qatida. He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Since how long have you been travelling 

along with me like this? I said: I have been travelling in this very state since the night. He said: May 

Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (from falling down), and again said: Do you see 

that we are hidden from the people? - and again said: Do you see anyone? I said: Here is a rider. I 

again said: Here Is another rider till we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) stepped aside of the highway and placed his head (for sleep and 

said): Guard for us our prayers. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was the first to 

wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled He (the Holy Prophet) 

said: Ride on So we rode on till the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from his camel 

and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in that. He performed ab-

393 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 04: THE BOOK OF PRAYERS (KITAB AL-SALAT)

lution with that which was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions and some water of 

that had been left. He (the Holy Prophet) said to Abu Qatida: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it 

would have (a miraculous) condition about it. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer and then the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed two rak'ahs and then said the morning pray-

er as he said every day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (then) rode on and we rode 

along with him and some of us whispered to the others saying: How would there be compensation 

for omission in our prayers? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in me (my life) a 

model for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) emission is that one should not say 

prayer (intentionally) till the time of the other prayer comes. So he who did like it (omitted prayer in 

sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should say prayer when he becomes aware of it 

and on the next day he should observe it at its prescribed time.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: What do you think the people would have done (at this hour)? They 

would have in the morning found their Apostle missing from amongst them and then Abu Bakr and 

'Umar would have told them that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) must be behind 

you, he cannot leave you behind (him), but the people said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed Abu Bakr and Umar, you would have gone on the 

right path. So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind) 

and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they (the Companions of the 

Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) re-

marked: There is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring that small cup of mine and he then 

asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

began to pour water (in that small cup) and Abu Qatida gave them to drink. And when the people 

saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satiate all of you. Then they (the 

Companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety) 

and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to fill (the cap), and I began to serve 

them till no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He then 

filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it. I said: Messenger of Allah, I would not drink till 

you drink. Upon this he said: The server of the people Is the last among them to drink. So I drank and 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also drank and the people came to the place of wa-

ter quite happy and satiated. 'Abdullah b. Rabah said: I am going to narrate this hadith in the great 

mosque, when 'Imran b. Husain said: See, O young man, how will you narrate for I was also one of 

the riders on that night? I said: So you must be knowing this hadith well. He said: Who are you? I 

said: I am one of the Ansar. Upon this he said: You narrate, for you know your hadith better. I, there-

fore, narrated it to the people. 'Imran said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else 

who learnt it so well as you have learnt.

'Imran b. Husain reported: I was with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) in a journey. 

We travelled the whole of the night, and when it was about to dawn, we got down for rest, and were 

overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone. Abu Bakr was the first to awake amongst us. and we did 

not awake the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of 

his own accord). It was 'Umar who then woke up. He stood by the side of the Apostle of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said: Proceed on. He 

travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from his camel) and led us in the 

morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along 

with us. After having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to 

him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I 

was not in a state of purity. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered him arid lie 

performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately along 

with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were traveling when we came across 

a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags. We said 

to her: How far is water available? She, said: Far, very far, very far. You cannot get water. We (again) 

said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a 

day and night journey. We said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). 

She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she 

had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children. He ordered that her camel should be 

made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag). The camel was then 

raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all 

leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we 

did not make any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of ex-

cess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the bits (of estable 

things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her: Take it away. This is meant for 

your children, and know that we have not its any way done any loss to your water. W hen she came 

to her family she said: I have met the greatest magician amongst human beings, or he is an apostle, 

as he claims to be, and she then narrated what had happened and Allah guided aright those people 

through that woman. She affirmed her faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam.

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Don't you read the Qur'an? I said: Yes. Upon this she

form me about the observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him). She said: Did you not recite:" O thou wrapped up"? He said: Yes. She said: Allah, the Exalted and 

the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this Surah obligatory.

So the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him and his Companions around him observed this 

(night prayer) for one year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months 

in the Heaven till (at the end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah which 

lightened (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after 

being an obligatory one. I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: I used to prepare tooth stick for him and water for his ab-

lution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth 

stick, and perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs, and would not sit but in the eighth one 

and would remember Allah, and praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would get up without utte-

ring the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then sit, remember, praise Him and suppli-

cate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two rak'ahs sit-

ting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'ahs. O my son, but when the Apostle of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) grew old and put on flesh, he observed Witr of seven, doing in the 

two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that made nine. O my son, and when the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) observed prayer, he liked to keep on observing it, and when sleep or pain 

overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer in the night, he prayed twelve 

rak'ahs daring the day. I am not aware of Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon him) having recited 

the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying through the night till morning, or fasting a

it is sufficiently hot 

Book 004, Number 1630: 

Zaid b. Arqam, on seeing some people praying in the forenoon, said: They well know that prayer at

prayer of those who are penitent is observed when your weaned camels feel the heat of the sun.

Book 004, Number 1631: 

Zaid b. Arqam reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went out to the peo-

Chapter 113: Night prayer consists of pairs of rak'ahs 

and witr is a rak'ah at the end of the night 

Book 004, Number 1632: 

Ibn 'Umar reported that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about 

the night prayer. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Prayer during the night 

should consist of pairs of rak'ahs, but if one of you fears morning is near, he should pray one rak'ah 

which will make his prayer an odd number for him.

Book 004, Number 1633: 

Salim reported on the authority of his father that a person asked the Apostle of Allah (may peace

Book 004, Number 1634: 

'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported: A man stood up and said. Messenger of Allah, how is the night pray-

er? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The night prayer consists of pair, but if 

you apprehend the rise of dawn, make it odd number by observing one rak'ah.

'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported: A person asked the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as I 

stood between him (the Holy Prophet) and the inquirer and he said: Messenger of Allah, how is the 

night prayer? He (the Holy Prophet) said: It consists of pairs of rak'ahs, but if you apprehend mor-

ning, you should pray one rak'ah and make the end of your prayer as Witr. Then a person asked him 

(the Holy Prophet) at the end of the year and I was at that place near the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) ; but I do not know whether he was the same person or another person, but he 

(the Holy Prophet) gave him the same reply.

Ibn 'Umar reported: A person called (the attention) of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon

night prayer an odd number? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (way peace he upon him) said: He 

who prays (night prayer) he should observe it in pairs, but if he apprehends the rise of morning, he 

should observe one rak'ah; that would make the number odd (for the rak'ahs) observed by him. This 

was narrated by Abd Kuraib 'Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah and Ibn 'Umar did not make mention of it.

Book 004, Number 1645: 

Anas b. Sirin reported: I asked Ibn 'Umar to tell me about the practice of the Holy Prophet (may 

peace be upon him) in regard to two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer: Should I make lengthy recitati-

on in them? He said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to observe, the night 

prayer in pairs and then made the number odd by observing one rak'ah. I said: I am not asking you 

about it. He said: You are a bulky man, will you not show me the patience to narrate to you the ha-

dith completely? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to observe the night prayer 

in pairs and then made the number odd by observing one rak'ah, and then he observed two rak'ahs 

before dawn quite close to the call for prayer (Khalaf said:" Did you see [yourself the Holy Prophet 

observing] the two rak'ahs before the dawn?" and he made no mention of prayer.)

Anas b. Sirin reported: I asked Ibn 'Umar like this (as recorded in the previous hadith) and he

Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who amongst you is

Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to exhort (his Com-

panions) to pray (at night) during Ramadan without commanding them to observe it as an obligatory 

act, and say: He who observed the night prayer in Ramadan because of faith and seeking his reward 

(from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven. When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

Book 004, Number 1667: 

'A'isha reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out during the night and 

observed prayer in the mosque and some of the people prayed along with him. When it was morning 

the people talked about this and so a large number of people gathered there. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) went out for the second night, and they (the people) prayed along with 

him. When it was morning the people began to talk about it. So the mosque thronged with people on 

the third night. He (the Holy Prophet) came out and they prayed along with him. When it was the 

fourth night, the mosque was filled to its utmost capacity but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) did not come out. Some persons among then cried:" Prayer." But the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) did not come to them till he came out for the morning prayer. When he 

had completed the morning prayer, he turned his face to the people and recited Tashahhud (I bear 

testi- mony that there is no god but Allah and I bear testimony that Muhammad is His Messen- ger) 

and then said: Your affair was not hidden from me in the night, but I was afraid that (my observing 

prayer continuously) might make the night prayer obligatory for you and you might be unable to 

perform it.

Ubayy said: By Allah I there is no god but He, that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is in Ramadhan (He swore wi-

thout reservation: ) By Allah, I know the night; it is the night on which the Messenger of Allah (may

Ibn 'Abbas reported: I spent a night with my material aunt (sister of my mother) Maimuna. The 

Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) got up during the night and relieved himself, then washed 

his face and hands and went to sleep. He then got up again, and came to the water skin and loosened 

its straps, then performed good ablution between the two extremes. He then stood up and observed 

prayer. I also stood up and stretched my body fearing that he might be under the impression that I 

was there to find out (what he did at night). So I also performed ablution and stood up to pray, but I 

stood on his left. He took hold of my hand and made me go round to his right side. The Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) completed thirteen rak'abs of his night prayer. He then lay down and 

slept and snored (and it was his habit to snore while asleep). Then Bilal came and he informed him 

about the prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) then stood up for prayer and did not perform ablution, and 

his supplication included there words:" O Allah, place light in my heart, light in my sight, light in my 

hearing, light on my right hand, light on my left hand, light above me, light below me, light in front 

of me, light behind me, and enhance light for me."

Kuraib (the narrator) said: There are seven (words more) which are in my heart (but I cannot re-

call them) and I met some of the descendants of 'Abbas and they narrated these words to me and 

mentioned in them: (Light) in my sinew, in my flesh, in my blood, in my hair, in my skin, and made a

the cushion, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his wife lay down on it 

length-wise. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) slept up till midnight, or a little befo-

re midnight of a little after midnight, and then got up and began to cast off the effects of sleep from 

his face by rubbing with his hand, and then recited the ten concluding verses of Surah 'Imran. He 

then stood up near a hanging water-skin and performed ablution well, and then stood up and pray-

ed, 'Ibn 'Abbas said: I also stood up and did the same, as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) had done, and then went to him and stood by his side. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) placed his right hand upon my head and took hold of my right ear and twistedit, and then 

observed a pair of rak'ahs, again a pair of rak'ahs, again a pair of rak'ahs, again a pair of rak'ahs, 

again a pair of rak'ahs, again a pair of rak'ahs, and then observed Witr and then lay down till the 

Mu'adhdhin came to him. He (the Holy Prophet) then stood up and observed two short rak'ahs, and 

then went out (to the mosque) and observed the dawn prayer.

Thou art exalted. I seek forgiveness from Thee and turn to Thee in repentance: and when he would 

bow, he would say: O Allah, it is for Thee that I bowed. I affirm my faith in Thee and I submit to 

Thee, and submit humbly before Thee my hearing, my eyesight, my marrow, my bone, my sinew; and 

when he would raise his head, he would say: O Allah, our Lord, praise is due to Thee, (the praise) 

with which is filled the heavens and the earth, and with which is filled that (space) which exists bet-

ween them, and filled with anything that Thou desireth afterward. And when he prostrated himself, 

he (the Holy Prophet) would say: O Allah, it is to Thee that I prostrate myself and it is in Thee that I 

affirm my faith, and I submit to Thee. My face is submitted before One Who created it, and shaped it, 

and opened his faculties of hearing and seeing. Blessed is Allah, the best of Creators; and he would 

then say between Tashahhud and the pronouncing of salutation: Forgive me of the earlier and later

Thou art the First and the Last. There is no god, but Thee.

proceeded on; I then thought that he would perhaps recite the whole (surah) in a rak'ah, but he pro-

ceeded and I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this surah). He then started al-Nisa', 

and recited it; he then started Al-i-'Imran and recited leisurely. And when he recited the verses 

which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified (by saying Subhan Allah-Glory to my Lord the Gre-

at), and when he recited the verses which tell (how the Lord) is to be begged, he (the Holy Prophet) 

would then beg (from Him), and when he recited the verses dealing with protection from the Lord,

he sought (His) protection and would then bow and say: Glory be to my Mighty Lord; his bowing 

lasted about the same length of time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture 

after ruku') he would say: Allah listened to him who praised Him, and he would then stand about the 

same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say: Glory be to 

my Lord most High, and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing. In the

Shaqiq reported: A person from Banu Bajila who was called Nabik b. Sinan came to Abdullah and 

said: I recite mufassal surahs in one rak'ah. Upon this 'Abdullah said: (You recite) like the recitation 

of poetry. I know the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) recited two 

surahs in one rak'ah.

Book 004, Number 1796: 

Abu Wa'il reported: A person came to 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud and said: I recited all the mufassal sur-

ahs in one rak'ah during the night. 'Abdullah said: You must have recited hastily like the recitation of 

poetry. 'Abdullah said: I remember well the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) used to combine them, and he then mentioned twenty of the mufassal surahs, and (their 

combinations in) two in every rak'ah.

Chapter 141: That which concerns recitation 

Book 004, Number 1797: 

Abu Ishaq reported: I saw a man asking Aswad b. Yazid who taught the Qur'an in the mosque: 

How do you recite the verse (fahal min muddakir) whether (the word muddakir) Is with (d) or (dh)? 

He (Aswad) said: It was with (d). I heard Abdullah b. Mas'ud saying that he had heard the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) reciting (muddakir) with (d).

Ishaq is reported to have said on the authority of Aswad who quoted on the authority of 'Abdullah 

b. Mas'ud that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to recite these words as (fahal min 

muddakir).

Book 004, Number 1799: 

'Alqama reported. We went to Syria and Abu Darda' came to us and said: Is there anyone among 

you who recites according to the recitation of Abdullah? I said: Yes, it is I. He again said: How did 

you hear 'Abdullah reciting this verse: (wa'l-lail-i-idha yaghsha = when the night covers)? He ('Al-

qama) said: I heard him reciting it (like this) (wa'l-lail-i-idha yaghsha) wa-dhakar wal untha = 

when the night covers and the males and the females). Upon this he said: By Allah, I heard the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) reciting in this way, but they (the Muslims of Syria) desire 

us to recite: (wa ma khalaqa), but I do not yield to their desire.

Chapter 143: How 'Amr b. 'Abasa embraced Islam 

Book 004, Number 1812: 

'Amr b. 'Abasa Sulami reported: I in the state of the Ignorance (before embracing Islam) used to 

think that the people were in error and they were not on anything (which may be called the right 

path) and worshipped the idols. In the meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news 

(on the basis of his prophetic knowledge) ; so I sat on my ride and went to him. The Messenger of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I ad-

opted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the 

Holy Prophet) and I said to him: Who are you? He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah). I again said: Who is 

a Prophet? He said: (I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah. I said: What is that 

which you have been sent with? He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness 

and affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is 

to be associated with Him. I said: Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A 

free man and a slave. He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr and Bilal were there with him among those 

who had embraced Islam by that time. I said: I intend to follow you. He said: During these days you 

would not be able to do so. Don't you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are li-

ving? You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you 

come to me. So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messengerof Allah (may peace be 

upon him) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he 

arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): 

How is that person getting on who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, 

while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on hea-

ring It) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognise me? He 

said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is so. I again said: Prophet of Allah, 

tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer.

He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it Is fully up, for 

when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it 

at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes 

about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the sha-

dow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you pray the after-

noon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of devil, and at that time 

the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it. I said: Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also. He 

said: None of you who uses water for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, 

but the sins of his face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has 

commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water. Then (when) he 

washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along with water from his finger-

467 / 1800

BOOK 04: THE BOOK OF PRAYERS (KITAB AL-SALAT)

tips. And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall out from the points of his hair along with 

water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along 

with water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what beco-

mes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins would depart leaving him (as innocent) 

as he was on the day his mother bore him. 'Amr b. 'Abasa narrated this hadith to Abu Umama, a 

Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and Abu Umama said to him: 'Amr 

b. 'Abasa, think what you are saying that such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only 

in the act of ablution and prayer). Upon this 'Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones 

have become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute a lie to 

Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I would have never 

narrated it, but I have heard it from him on occasions more than these.

Chapter 144: Do not get into the habit of observing 

prayer at the time of the rising sun and at the time

Book 004, Number 1813: 

'A'isha reported that 'Umar misconstrued the fact that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) had prohibited the observance of prayer at the time of the rising sun and at the time of its set-

Book 004, Number 1814: 

'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not abandon observing two 

rak'ahs after 'Asr, but she reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not get

him), telling him to give her their greetings, and ask her about the two rak'ahs after the afternoon 

prayer, (for)" we have heard that you observe them whereas it has been conveyed to us that the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prohibited their observance." Ibn 'Abbas said: I along with 

'Umar b. al-Khattab dissuaded people to do so (to observe two rak'ahs of prayer). Kuraib said: I went 

468 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 04: THE BOOK OF PRAYERS (KITAB AL-SALAT)

to her ('A'isha) and conveyed to her the message with which I was sent. She said: (Better) ask Umm 

Salama. So I went to them (those who had sent him to Hadrat 'A'isha) and informed them about what 

she had said. They sent me back to Umm Salama with that with which I was sent to 'A'isha. Umm Sa-

lama said: I beard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prohibiting them, and then af-

terwards I saw him observing them. And when he observed them (two rak'ahs) he had already ob-

served the 'Asr prayer. Then he (the Holy Prophet) came, while there were with me ladies of Banu 

Haram, a tribe of the Ansar and he (the Holy Prophet) observed them (the two rak'ahs). I sent a slave-

girl to him asking her to stand by his side and say to him that Umm Salama says: Messenger of Allah, 

I heard you prohibiting these two rak'ahs, whereas I saw you observing them; and if he (the Holy 

Prophet) points with his hand (to wait), then do wait. The slave-girl did like that. He (the Holy Pro-

phet) pointed out with his hand and she got aside and waited, and when he had finished (the prayer) 

he said: Daughter of Abu Umayya. you have asked about the two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer. Some 

people of 'Abu al-Qais came to me for embracing Islam and hindered me from observing the two 

rak'ahs which come after the noon prayer. So those are the two I have been praying.

Book 004, Number 1816: 

Abu Salama asked 'A'isha about the two prostrations (i. e. rak'ahs) which the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) made after the 'Asr. She said: He (the Holy Prophet) observed them before 

the 'Asr prayer, but then he was hindered to do so, or he forgot them and then he observed them af-

ter the 'Asr, and then he continued observing them. (It was his habit) that when he (the Holy Pro-

phet) observed prayer, he then continued observing it. Isma'il said: It implies that he always did that.

Book 004, Number 1817: 

'A'isha reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not abandon at all obser-

ving two rak'ahs after the 'Asr in my house.

observe them? He said: He saw us observing them, but he neither commanded us nor forbade us to 

do so.

Anas b. Malik reported: When we were in Medina, the moment the Mu'adhdhin made the call to 

the sunset prayer, the people hastened to the pillars of the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs with the 

result that any stranger coming into the mosque would think that the obligatory prayer had been 

observed owing to the number who were praying then.

group stood In front of the enemy. Then those who were with (him) observed one rak'ah of prayer 

and they went back and the others came and they observed one rak'ah (with him). Then both the 

groups completed one rak'ah each. Ibn Umar said: When there is greater danger, then observe pray-

er even on the ride or with the help of gestures in a standing posture.

Book 004, Number 1826: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I observed prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah (may peace

and the Qibla. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah is Most Great, and we all 

said it. He then bowed and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing, we all raised (our 

heads). He then went down in prostration along with the row close to him, and the rear row faced 

the enemy; then when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) completed the prostration, ; and 

then stood up, the row near to him also did it; then went down the rear row in prostration; then they 

stood up; then the rear row went to the front and the front row went to the rear. Then the Apostle of 

Allah (may peace he upon him) bowed down and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bo-

wing and we also raised (our heads). He and the row close to him which I had been in the rear then 

went down in prostration In the first rak'ah, whereas the rear row faced the enemy. And when the 

Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the rear row close to him had finished the prostration, 

the rear row went down and prostrated themselves; then the Apostle of Allah pronounced the saluta-

tion and we also pronounced the salutation. (Jabir said we hadith) as your guards behave with their

said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He bowed and we also bowed. He went down in pro-

stration and the first row prostrated along with him. When they stood up, the second row went 

down in prostration. Then the first row went into the rear, and the second row came in the front and 

occupied the place of the first row. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said: Allah 

is Most Great, and we also said so. He then bowed, and we also bowed. He then went down in pro-

stration and along with him the row also (went down in prostration), and the second row remained 

standing. And when the second row had also prostrated and all of them sat down then the Messen-

Chapter 147: Kitab al-jumu'a 

We have already explained that Islam exhorts its followers to make their social life a visible ex-

pression of God-consciousness. Prayer is the most effective means of fostering this virtue in man 

That is the reason why it has been made essential for the Muslims to observe obligatory prayers in 

congregation. Jumu'a is a step forward in this respect. The purpose behind it is to provide opportuni-

ties to the greater number of Muslims to attend larger congregations in the mosques in an atmos-

phere of religions piety. Apart from prayer, sermon has also been made an integral part of the Ju-

mu'a prayer. The Imam delivers the sermon and instructs people in religion. He explains to them the 

day-to-day problems in the light of Islam.

his hand to sit down. He then made his way through their (assembly) till he came to the women. Bilal 

was with him. He then recited (this verse): O Prophet, when believing women come to thee giving 

thee a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah" (lx. 12) till he finished (his address to) 

them and then said: Do you conform to it (what has been described in the verse)? Only one woman 

among them replied: Yes, Apostle of Allah, but none else replied. He (the narrator) said: It could not 

be ascertained who actually she was. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted them to give alms. Bilal stret-

ched his cloth and then said: Come forward with alms. Let my father and mother be taken as ransom

the sermon. When the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had finished (the sermon) he came 

down from (the pulpit), and made his way to the women and exhorted them (to do good acts), and 

he was leaning on the hand of Bilal. Bilal had stretched his cloth in which women were throwing 

alms. I (one of the narrators) said to 'Ata' (the other narrator): It must be Zakat on the day of Fitr. He 

('Ata') said: No. It was alms (which) they were giving on that occasion, and a woman gave her ring, 

and then others gave, and then others gave. I said to 'Ata': Is It right now for the Imam to come to the 

women when he has finished (his address to the men) that he should exhort them (to good deeds)? 

He said: (Why not) by my life, it is right for them (to do so). What is the matter with them that they 

do not do it now?

of) Allah, and he exhorted (them) on obedience to Him, and he preached to the people and admonis-

hed them. He then walked on till he came to the women and preached to them and admonished 

them, and asked them to give alms, for most of them are the fuel for Hell. A woman having a dark 

spot on the cheek stood up and said: Why is it so, Messenger of Allah? He said: For you grumble often 

and show ingratitude to your spouse. And then they began to give alms out of their ornaments such 

as their earrings and rings which they threw on to the cloth of Bilal.

prayer and pronounced the salutation, he stood up facing people as they were seated at their places 

of worship. And if he intended to send out an army he made mention of it to the people, and if he in-

tended any other thing besides it, he commanded them (to do that). He used to say (to the people): 

Give alms, give alms, give alms, and the majority that gave alms was of women. He then returned 

and this (practice) remained (in vogue) till Marwan b. al- Hakam (came into power). I went out 

hand in hand with Marwan till we came to the place of worship and there Kathir b. Salt had built a 

pulpit of clay and brick. Marwan began to tug me with his hand as though he were pulling me to-

wards the pulpit, while I was pulling him towards the prayer. When I saw him doing that I said: 

What has happened to the practice of beginning with prayer? He said: No, Abu Sa'id, what you are 

familiar with has been abandoned. I thereupon said (three times and went back): By no means, by 

Him in Whose hand my life is, you are not doing anything better than what I am familiar with.

Chapter 172: Prayer at the time of solar eclipse 

Book 004, Number 1966: 

'A'isha reported that there was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him). He stood up to pray and prolonged his stand very much. He then bowed and prolonged 

very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his stand much, but it was less than 

the (duration) of the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the 

duration of his first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the stand, but it 

was less than the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first 

bowing. He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his stand, but it was less than the 

first stand. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first bowing. He then pro-

strated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. 

He praised Allah and landed Him and said: The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not 

eclipsed on account of anyones death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify 

and supplicate Allah, observe prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant 

than Allah When His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you 

knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.

'A'isha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported There was an eclipse of 

the sun during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). So, the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace he upon him) went to the mosque and stood up and glorified Allah, and the people 

formed themselves in rows behind him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a 

long recital (of the Qur'an) and then pronounced takbir and then observed a long ruku'. He then rai-

sed his head and said: Allah listened to him who praised Him: our Lord, praise is due to Thee. He then 

again stood up and made a long recital, which was less than the first recital. He pronounced takbir 

and observed a long ruku', and it was less than the first one. He again said: Allah listened to him who 

praised Him; our Lord, praise is due to Thee. (Abu Tahir, one of the narrators) made no mention of:" 

He then prostrated himself." He did like this in the second rak'ah, till he completed four rak'ahs and 

four prostrations and the sun became bright before he deported. He then stood up and addressed 

people, after lauding Allah as He deserved, and then said: The sun and the moon are two signs 

among the signs of Allah These do not eclipse either on the death of anyone or on his birth. So when 

you see them, hasten to prayer. He also said this: Observe prayer till Allah dispels the anxiety (of this 

extraordinary phenomenon) from you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I saw 

in my place everything which you have been promised. I even saw myself desiring to pluck a bunch 

(of grapes) from Paradise (and it was at the time) when you saw me moving forward. And I saw Hell 

and some of its parts crushing the others, when you saw me moving back; and I saw in it Ibn Luhayy 

and he was the person who made the she-camels loiter about. In the hadith transmitted by Abu Ta-

rously long time. He then bowed and then stood up and then bowed and then stood up and then bo-

wed, thus observing three ruku's in two rak'ahs and four prostrations. He then departed and the sun 

brightened. He pronounced" Allah is the Greatest" while bowing. He would then bow and say:" Allah 

listened to him who praised Him" while lifting up his head. He then stood up, and praised Allah and 

lauded Him, and then said: The sun and the moon do not eclipse on the death of anyone or on his 

birth. But both of them are among the signs of Allah with which Allah terrifies His servants. So when 

you see them under eclipse, remember Allah till they are brightened. This hadith is narrated thus on

the graves? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (May there be) protection of Al-

lah! The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) mounted one morning on the ride, and the 

sun eclipsed. 'A'isha said: I came in the company of the women in the mosque from behind the 

rooms. The Messenger of Allah (way peace he upon him) dismounted from his ride and came to the 

place of worship where he used to pray. He stood up (to pray) and the people stood behind him. 

'A'isha said: He stood for a long time. He then bowed and it was a long ruku'. He then raised his head 

and he stood for a long time, less than the first standing. He then bowed and his ruku' was long, but 

it was less than that (the first) ruku'. He then raised (his head) and the sun had become bright. He

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: The sun eclipsed on one extremely hot day during the lifetime of the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

prayed along with his Companions. He prolonged his qiyam (standing posture in prayer) till they 

(his Companions) began to fall down. He then observed a long ruku'. He raised his head (and stood 

up for long) and then observed a long ruku'. He then raised (his head and stood up) for a long time 

and then made two prostrations. He then stood up and did like this and thus he observed four ruku's 

and four prostrations (in two rak'ahs) and then said: All these things were brought to me in which 

you will be made to enter. Paradise was brought to me till (I was so close to it) that if I (had intended) 

to pluck a bunch (of grapes) out of it. I would have got it, or he (the Holy Prophet) said: I intended to 

get a bunch (out of that) but my hand could not reach it. Hell was also brought to me and I saw in it 

a woman belonging to the tribe of Israel who was tormented for a cat whom she had tied, but did not 

give it food nor set it free to eat the creatures of the earth; and I saw Abu Thumama 'Amr b. Malik 

who was dragging his intestines in Hell. They (the Arabs) used to say that the sun and the moon do 

not eclipse but on the death of some great person; but (in reality) both these (the sun and the moon) 

are among the signs of Allah which are shown to you; so when there is an eclipse, observe prayer till 

it (the sun or the moon) brightens. This hadith has been narrated by Hisham with the same chain of

Jabir reported that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

be upon him) stood up and led people in (two rak'ahs of) prayer with six ruku's and four prostrati-

ons. He commenced (the prayer) with takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) and then recited and prolonged his re-

cital. He then bowed nearly the (length of time) that he stood up. He then raised his head from the 

ruku' and recited but less than the first recital. He then bowed (to the length of time) that he stood 

up. He then raised his head from the ruku' and again recited but less than the second recital. He then 

bowed (to the length of time) that he stood up. He then lifted his head from the ruku'. He then fell in 

prostration and observed two prostrations. He stood up and then bowed, observing six ruku's like it, 

without (completing) the rak'ah in them, except (this difference) that the first (qiyam of ruku') was 

longer than the later one, and the ruku' was nearly (of the same length) as prostration. He then mo-

ved backward and the rows behind him also moved backward till we reached the extreme (Abu Bakr 

said: till he reached near the women) He then moved forward and the people also moved forward

along with him till he stood at his (original) place (of worship). He then completed the prayer as it 

was required to complete and the sun brightened and he said: O people! verily the sun and the moon 

are among the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse at the death of anyone among people (Abu Bakr 

said: On the death of any human being). So when you see anything like it (of the nature of eclipse), 

pray till it is bright. There is nothing which you have been promised (in the next world) but I have 

seen it in this prayer of mine. Hell was brought to me as you saw me moving back on account of fear 

lest its heat might affect me; and I saw the owner of the curved staff who dragged his intestines in 

the fire, and he used to steal (the belongings) of the pilgrims with his curved staff. If he (the owner of 

the staff) became aware, he would say: It got (accidentally) entangled in my curved staff, but if he 

was unaware of that, he would take that away. I also saw in it (in Hell) the owner of a cat whom she 

had tied and did not feed her nor set her free so that she could eat the creatures of the earth, till the 

cat died of starvation. Paradise was brought to me, and it was on that occasion that you saw me mo-

ving forward till I stood at my place (of worship). I stretched my hand as I wanted to catch hold of its 

fruits so that you may see them. Then I thought of not doing it. Nothing which you have been promi-

sed was there that I did not see in this prayer of mine.

Book 004, Number 1977:

that they are praying (a special prayer)? She ('A'isha) pointed towards the sky with her head. I said: Is 

it (an unusual) sign? She said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up for 

prayer for such a long time that I was about to faint. I caught hold of a waterskin lying by my side, 

and began to pour water over my head, or (began to sprinkle water) on my face. The Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) then finished and the sun had brightened. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) then addressed the people, (after) praising Allah and lauding Him, and 

then said: There was no such thing as I did not see earlier, but I saw it at this very place of mine. I 

ever saw Paradise and Hell. It was also revealed to me that you would be tried in the graves, as you 

would he tried something like the turmoil of the Dajjal. Asma' said: I do not know which word he ac-

tually used (qariban or mithl), and each one of you would be brought and it would be said: What is 

your knowledge about this man? If the person is a believer, (Asma' said: I do not know whether it 

was the word al-Mu'min or al-Mu'qin) he would say: He is Muhammad and he is the Messenger of 

Allah. He brought to us the clear signs and right guidance. So we responded and obeyed him. (He 

would repeat this three times), and it would be said to him: You should go to sleep. We already knew 

that you are a believer in him. So the pious man would go to sleep. So far as the hypocrite or sceptic 

is concerned (Asma' said: I do not know which word was that: al-Munafiq (hypocrite) or al-Murtad

the mosque. I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) standing in prayer. I stood along 

with him. He prolonged his qiyam till I wished to sit down. Then I cast a glance towards an old wo-

man. So I said: She is older than I. I, therefore, kept standing. He (the Holy Prophet) then observed

served prostration, and then he finished, and the sun had cleared (by that time). He (the Holy Pro-

phet) then said: The sun and moon are two signs from the signs of Allah. These two do not eclipse on 

account of the death of anyone or on account of the birth of anyone. So when you see that, remem-

ber Allah. They (his Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, we saw you reach out to something, whi-

le you were standing here, then we saw you restrain yourself. He said: I saw Paradise and reached 

out to a bunch of its grapes; and had I taken it you would have eaten of it as long as the world endu-

red. I saw Hell also. No such (abominable) sight have I ever seen as that which I saw today; and I ob-

served that most of its inhabitants were women. They said: Messenger of Allah, on what account is it 

so? He said: For their ingratitude or disbelief (bi-kufraihinna). It was said: Do they disbelieve in Al-

lah? He said: (Not for their disbelief in God) but for their ingratitude to their husbands and ingrati-

tude to kindness. If you were to treat one of them kindly for ever, but if she later saw anything (dis-

Kitab-ul-jana'iz - book relating to the dead

A Divine Service is held over the dead body of every Muslim, young or old, even of infants who 

have lived only for a few minutes. A Muslim opens his eyes in the world with the words of Adhan in 

his ears in which he is told that he is a moral being having moral and spiritual responsibilities far 

more important than the physical needs. He should live in the world with a firm belief in the Creator 

of the Universe as his only Deity. Then he should spend his life as a sincere and devoted follower of 

Muhammad (may peace be upon him), for it is through him that he has received full information 

about the Will of God and the Divine Code of life. It Is also imprinted upon his fresh and clear mind 

that prayer elevates the soul of man and herein lies his success in this world and the world to come. 

With this sacred message he is made to start his life. Both the paths are shown to him, the path of 

508 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 04: THE BOOK OF PRAYERS (KITAB AL-SALAT)

righteousness and religious piety and the path of evil and irreligiousness, and then it is left to his dis-

cretion to choose the path he likes. After spending the allotted length of time he is called back to his 

Master.

When the soul leaves the body, preparations are made for bidding him the last farewell. He is 

washed and perfumed and is wrapped in white sheets. Then the funeral prayer is observed keeping 

his dead body in front of the Imam in which God to requested in congregation to grant him pardon 

for his minor and major sins, for all his failings and to wrap him in His Mercy.

A Muslim is received in this world with Adhan and lqama and he is given a send- off with prayer 

and supplication to Allah for treating him kindly in his heavenly home.

There is neither Adhan nor Iqama in the funeral prayer which has very deep significance. It im-

plies that the Adhan and lqama for the funeral prayer had been pronounced at the time of his birth. 

He is thus awakened to the realisation of the fact that he should spend the whole span of his life with 

such single-minded devotion as is found in a worshipper waiting for the commencement of prayer 

after the Adhan and Iqama are pronounced.

ger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If any servant (of Allah) who suffers a calamity says:" We be-

long to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me some-

thing better than it in exchange for it," ' Allah will give him reward for affliction, and would give 

him something better than it in exchange. She (Umm Salama) said: When Abu Salama died. I uttered 

(these very words) as I was commanded (to do) by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). 

So Allah gave me better in exchange than him. i. e. (I was taken as the wife of) the Messenger of Al-

When Abu Salama died, I went to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger 

of Allah, Abu Salama has died. He told me to recite:" O Allah! forgive me and him (Abu Salama) and 

give me a better substitute than he." So I said (this), and Allah gave me in exchange Muhammad, who

sight follows it. Some of the people of his family wept and wailed. So he said: Do not supplicate for 

yourselves anything but good, for angels say" Amen" to what you say. He then said: O Allah, forgive 

Abu Salama, raise his degree among those who are rightly guided, grant him a successor in his de-

scendants who remain. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the Universe, and make his grave spacious, 

and grant him light in it.

woman from the upper side of the city came there who intended to help me (in weeping). She hap-

pened to come across the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he said: Do you intend to 

bring the devil into a house from which Allah has twice driven him out? I (Umm Salama), therefore, 

refrained from weeping and I did not weep.

Book 004, Number 2008: 

Usama b. Zaid reported: While we were with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), one of 

his daughters sent to him (the Messenger) to call him and inform him that her child or her son was 

dying. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) told the messenger to go back and tell her 

that what Allah had taken belonged to Him, and to him belonged what He granted; and He has an 

appointed time for everything. So you (the messenger) order her to show endurance and seek reward 

from Allah. The messenger came back and said: She adjures him to come to her. He got up to go ac-

companied by Sa'd b. 'Ubada, Mu'adh b. Jabal, and I also went along with them. The child was lifted 

to him and his soul was feeling as restless as if it was in an old (waterskin). His (Prophet's) eyes wel-

led up with tears. Sa'd said: What is this, Messenger of Allah? He replied: This is compassion which 

Allah has placed in the hearts of His servants, and God shows compassion only to those of His ser-

vants who are compassionate.

and we were more than ten persons. We had neither shoes with us, nor socks, nor caps, nor shirts.

'Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika reported: I was sitting by the side of Ibn 'Umar, and we were waiting for 

the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman, and there was also 'Amr b. 'Uthman. In the meanwhile 

there came Ibn 'Abbas led by a guide. I conceive that he was informed of the place of Ibn 'Umar. So 

he came till he sat by my side. While I was between them (Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar) there came the 

noise (of wailing) from the house. Upon this Ibn 'Umar said (that is, he pointed out to 'Amr that he 

should stand and forbid them, for): I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as say-

ing: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family. 'Abdullah made it general (what 

was said for a particular occasion). Ibn 'Abbas said: When we were with the Commander of the be-

lievers, 'Umar b. Khattab, we reached Baida', and there was a man under the shadow of the tree. He 

said to me: Go and inform me who is that person. So I went and (found) that he was Suhaib. I retur-

ned to him and said: You commanded me to find out for you who that was, and he is Suhaib. He (Ha-

drat 'Umar) said: Command him to see us. I said: He has family along with him. He said: (That is of 

no account) even if he has family along with him. So he (the narrator) told him to see (the Comman-

der of the believers and his party). When we came (to Medina), it was before long that the Comman-

der of the believers was wounded, and Suhaib came weeping and crying: Alas for the brother, alas 

for the companion. Upon this 'Umar said: Didn't you know, or didn't you hear, that the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) said:" The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family"? 

Then 'Abdullah made it general and 'Umar told it of certain occasions. So I ('Abdullah b. Abu Mulai-

ka) stood up and went to 'A'isha and told her what Ibn 'Umar had said. Upon this she said: I swear by 

Allah that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) never said that dead would be punished be-

cause of his family's lamenting (for him). What he said was that Allah would increase the punish-

ment of the unbeliever because of his family's lamenting for him. Verily it is Allah Who has caused 

laughter and weeping. No bearer of a burden will bear another's burden. Ibn Abu Mulaika said that 

al-Qasim b. Muhammad said that when the words of 'Umar and Ibn 'Umar were conveyed to 'A'Isha, 

she said: You have narrated it to me from those who are neither liar nor those suspected of lying but 

(sometimes) hearing misleads.

He added: I (first sat) by the side of one of them, then the other one came and he sat by my side. 'Ab-

dullah b. 'Umar said to 'Amr b. 'Uthman who was sitting opposite to him: Will you not prevent the 

people from lamenting, for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:" The dead is 

punished because of the lamenting of his family for him"? Ibn 'Abbas then said that Umar used to say 

someting of that nature, and then narrated saying: I proceeded from Mecca along with 'Umar till we 

reached al-Baida' and there was a party of riders under the shade of a tree. He said (to me): Go and 

find out who this party is. I cast a glance and there was Suhaib (in that party). So I informed him 

('Umar) about it. He said: Call him to me. So I went back to Suhaib and said: Go and meet the Com-

mander of the believers. When 'Umar was wounded, Suhaib came walling: Alas, for the brother! alas 

for the companion! 'Umar said: O Suhaib, do you wail for me, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said:" The dead would be punished on account of the lamentation of the (mem-

bers of his family)"? Ibn 'Abbas said: When 'Umar died I made a mention of it to 'A'isha. She said: May 

Allah have mercy upon 'Umar! I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) ne-

ver said that Allah would punish the believer because of the weeping (of any one of the members of 

his family), but he said that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of the 

weeping of his family over him. 'A'isha said: The Qur'an is enough for you (when it states):" No bea-

rer of burden will bear another's burden" (vi. 164). Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas said: Allah is He Who has 

caused laughter and weeping. Ibn Abu Mulaika said: By Allah, Ibn 'Umar said nothing.

(the dead) is punished for his faults or for his sins, and the members of his family are wailing for him 

now. (This misunderstanding of Ibn 'Umar is similar to his saying: ) The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those polytheists who had 

been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to say, i. e.: They hear what I say. 

But he (Ibn 'Umar) misunderstood. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) had only said: They 

(the dead) understand that what I used to say to them was truth. She then recited:" Certainly, thou 

canst not make the dead hear the call" (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the gra-

ves, nor can you inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell.

'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. Zubair reported that 'A'isha ordered the bier of Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas to be 

brought into the mosque so that she should pray for him. The people disapproved this (act) of hers. 

She said: How soon the people have forgotten that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

offered not the funeral prayer of Suhail b al-Baida' but in a mosque.

'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. Zubair reported on the authority of 'A'isha that when Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas

dingly, and it was placed in front of their apartments and they offered prayer for him. It was brought 

out of the door (known as) Bab al-Jana'iz which was towards the side of Maqa'id, and the news rea-

ched them (the wives of the Holy Prophet) that the people bad criticised this (i. e. offering of funeral 

prayer in the mosque) saying that it was not desirable to take the bier inside the mosque. This was 

conveyed to 'A'isha. She said: How hastily the people criticise that about which they know little. They 

criticise us for carrying the bier in the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) of-

fered not the funeral prayer of Suhail b. Baida' but in the innermost part of the mosque.

Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Rahman reported on the authority ot 'A'isha that when Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas

in the mosque for the two sons of Baida', viz, for Suhail and his brother.

'A'isha reported (that whenever it was her turn for Allah's Messenger [may peace be upon him] to 

spend the night with her) he would go out towards the end of the night to al-Baqi' and say: Peace be 

upon you, abode of a people who are believers. What you were promised would come to you tomor-

row, you receiving it after some delay; and God willing we shall join you. O Allah, grant forgiveness 

to the inhabitants of Baqi' al-Gharqad. Qutaiba did not mention his words:" would come to you".

Muhammad b. Qais said (to the people): Should I not narrate to you (a hadith of the Holy Prophet)

given him birth. He (Muhammad b. Qais) then reported that it was 'A'isha who had narrated this: 

Should I not narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him)? We said: Yes. She said: When it was my turn for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

to spend the night with me, he turned his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed 

them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought 

that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened 

the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my 

waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi'. He stood there and he 

stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He

hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. He came (to the house) and I 

also came (to the house). I, however, preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in 

the bed, he (the Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O 'A'isha, that you are out of 

breath? I said: There is nothing. He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I 

said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the 

whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes. He 

struck me on the chest which caused me pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His 

Apostle would deal unjustly with you? She said: Whatsoever the people conceal, Allah will know it. 

He said: Gabriel came to me when you saw me. He called me and he concealed it from you. I respon-

ded to his call, but I too concealed it from you (for he did not come to you), as you were not fully 

dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep, and I did not like to awaken you, fearing that you may 

be frightened. He (Gabriel) said: Your Lord has commanded you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi' (to 

those lying in the graves) and beg pardon for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, how should I pray for 

them (How should I beg forgiveness for them)? He said: Say, Peace be upon the inhabitants of this 

city (graveyard) from among the Believers and the Muslims, and may Allah have mercy on those 

who have gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God willing, join you.

Book 004, Number 2128: 

Sulaiman b. Buraida narrated on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

tants of the city (i. e. graveyard)." In the hadith transmitted by Zuhair (the words are):" Peace be upon

BOOK 05: THE BOOK OF ZAKAT (KITAB AL-ZAKAT)

Introduction 

Of the five fundamentals of Islam, Zakat occupies the second positioin, the first being prayer (sa-

lat). This word is derived from Zakd, which means it (a plant) grew. The second derivative of this 

word carries the sense of purificatin, e. g. Qad aflaha man zakkaha (he is indeed successful who pu-

rified himself). The other word used for zakat both in the Qur'an and the Hadith is sadaqa which is 

derived from sidq (the truth). Both these words are highly meaningful. The spending of wealth for 

the sake of Allah purifies the heart of man of the love of material wealth. The man who spends it of-

fers that as a humble gift before the Lord and thus affirms the truth that nothing is dearer to him in 

life than the love of Allah and that he is full prepared to sacrifice everything for His sake. Secondly, 

zakat is the most effective measure to improve the economic condition of the have-nots. It is not, ho-

wever, a mere tax, but a form of worship whereby a man comes close to his Lord. The Muslims have, 

therefore, been enjoined to pay zakat with the same sense of earnestness and devotion in which the 

seeker of the Lord observes the prayer. The primary motive of zakat is religious and spiritual, while 

the social and economic aspects are subservient to it. Its social significance is that it awakens in man 

the sense of brotherhood with less fortunate members of society, and stirs his moral conscience to 

make sacrifice for their sake. From the economic point of view it discourages hoarding and concen-

tration of wealth and helps its steady and constant flow from the rich to the poor. It is in fact a good 

means of providing purchasing power to the poor, for ameliorating their hard lot and enabling them 

to stand on their own legs. 

It should also be remembered that zakat or sadaqa in Islam is not a voluntary act of charity which 

a rich man gives to the poor out of his own sweet will, but it is an obligatory act which every Muslim 

is enjoined upon to perform if he is sincere in his belief in God and the Hereafter. Thus there is no 

burden of obligation on one who receives zakat, but a sense of thankfulness and gratitude on the 

part of the giver, since he has been enabled by the recipient to discharge his obligation that he owes 

to God and society. 

(O Prophet), take sadaqa (zakat) out of their property-thou wouldst cleanse them and purify them 

thereby (Qur'an, ix. 103). And away from it (the Hell) shall be kept the most faithful to duty who gi-

ves his wealth, purifying himself (xcii. 17-18). 

So much is the importance of zakat in Islam that it has been mentioned at eightytwo places in the 

Qur'an in close connection with prayer. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) knew its basic importance in Islam. It is a known fact that after the death of the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace he upon him) when some of the tribes, who believed in the oneness of God and observed 

prayer, refused to pay zakat, the first Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him), in an ans-

wer to the advice of Hadrat 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) to show tolerance towards such peo-

ple. said in explicit terms, By Allah, I would definitely wage war against them who dissociate prayer 

from Zakat. Zakat is paid on the surplus of wealth which is left over after the passage of a year. It is 

540 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 05: THE BOOK OF ZAKAT (KITAB AL-ZAKAT)

thus a payment on the accumulated wealth. Leaving aside animals and agricultural yield, zakat is 

paid at almost a uniform rate of two and a half %. The minimum standard of surplus wealth over 

which zakat is charged is known as Nisab. It differs with different kinds of property, the most im-

portant being 200 dirhams or 521 tolas (nearly 21 oz.) In case of silver, and 20 mithqals or 71 tolas 

(nearly 3 oz.) in case of gold. The nisab of cash is the same as that of gold and silver. 

As regards the persons to whom zakat is to be paid, they have been clearly described in the Holy 

Qur'an: Alms are only for the poor, the needy, the officials charged with the duty of collection, those 

whose hearts are inclined to truth, the ransoming of captives, those in debt, in the way of Allah, and 

the wayfarer (ix 60).

forehead and his back would be cauterized with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) 

repeated during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronoun-

ced among servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: 

Messenger of Allah, what about the camel? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner of the camel 

does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it 

comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him,

as extensive as possible, (he will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample 

him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last 

of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, 

until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradi-

se or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep? He said: It 

any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection 

comes a soft sandy plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted 

horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample 

him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them would be made to re-

turn to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment would be 

pronounced among the servants. And he would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or 

to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse? Upon this he said: The horses are of 

three types. To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to 

another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who 

rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden 

for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah 

but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a cove-

ring for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake 

of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field. And whatever thing do these 

eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as would also the 

amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two 

without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his 

behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they 

drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of 

what they drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?, Upon 

this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one 

verse of a comprehensive nature:" He who does an atom's weight of good will see it, and he who does 

an atom's weight of evil will see it" (xcix. 7)

and these would be made into plates and with these his sides, his forehead would be cauterised till 

Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day, the extent of which would be 

fifty thousand years. He would then see his path, leading either to Paradise or to Hell. And no owner 

of the camels who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him 

and they (the camels) would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return 

till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day the extent of which would be 

fifty thousand years. He would then see his path leading him to Paradise or leading him to Hell. And 

no owner of the (cattle and) goats who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain 

would be set for him, he would find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or 

with broken horns, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs and 

they would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would 

pronounce judgment among His servants, during a day the extent of which would be fdty thousand 

years, and he would see the paths leading to Paradise or to Hell. Suhail said: I do not know whether 

he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), what about 

the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrai-

ned in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the 

Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a 

covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a 

person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing 

disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze 

in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to 

drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be 

reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and 

dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that 

they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and 

dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As re-

gards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to 

the people; for him they are, the burden. They said: Messenger of Allah, what about asses? He said: 

Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to it except this one comprehensive verse:" He who 

does an atom's weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom's weight of evil will see it" (xcix.

Book 005, Number 2166: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The 

owner of a camel who does not pay what is due on it (would be punished in this way) that on the 

Day of Resurrection many more (along with his camel) would come and the owner would be made 

to sit on a soft sandy ground and they would trample him with their feet and hooves. And no owner 

of the cattle who does not pay what is due on them (would be spared the punishment) but on the 

Day of Resurrection, many more would come and he (the owner) would be made to sit on the soft 

sandy ground and would be gored by their horns and trampled under their feet. And no owner of 

the goats and sheep who does not pay what is due on them (would be spared of punishment) but 

many more would come on the Day of Resurrection and he (the owner) would be made to sit on a 

soft sandy ground and they would gore him with their horns and trample him under their hooves. 

And there would be more (among this flock of sheep and goat) without horns or with broken horns. 

And no owner of the treasure who does not pay its due but his treasure would come on the Day of 

Resurrection like a bald snake and would pursue him with its mouth open, and when it would come 

near he would run away from it, and he would be called thus:" Take your treasure which you con-

cealed, for I do not need it." When he would find no way out he would put his hand in its mouth and 

it would gnaw it like a he-camel. Abu Zubair said: We heard Ubaid b. Umair saying this. We then 

asked Jabir b. 'Abdullah about this. And he also said like Ubaid b. Umair, Abu Zubair said: I heard 

'Ubaid b. 'Umair saying: A man said: Messenger of Allah, what is due on camels? He said: Milking 

them near water, and lending of bucket (used for drawing water from it), or lending its male for ma-

ting with a she-camel and providing it as a ride for the sake of Allah.

Book 005, Number 2167: 

Jabir b. Abdullah reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: No owner of

would trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. And none of them on that day 

would be without horns, or with broken horns. We said: Messenger of. Allab, but what is due on 

them? He said: Lending of the male (for use) and lending of the bucket (used for drawing water for 

them) and for mating and milking them near water and providing them as a ride for the sake of Al-

lah. And no owner of the property who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but it (his 

property) would turn into a bald snake and would follow its owner wherever he would go, and he

my father, be ransom for you, who are they (the losers)? He said: They are those having a huge 

amount of wealth except so and so and (those who spend their wealth generously on them whom 

they find in front of them, behind them and on their right side and on their left side) and they are a 

few. And no owner of camels, or cattle or goat and sheep, who does not pay Zakat (would be spared 

punishment) but these (camels, cattle, goats and sheep) would come on the Day of Resurrection wea-

ring more flesh and would gore him with their horns and trample them with their hooves. And 

when the last one would pass away, the first one would return (to trample him) till judgment would

any dinar but one coin which I would keep to pay debt. (I love) to spend it among the servants of Al-

stay where you are till I come back to you. He (the Holy Prophet) then moved on till he disappeared

said: The wealthy persons would have little (reward) on the Day of Resurrection, except upon whom 

Allah conferred goodness (wealth). He dispensed it to his right, left, in front of him and at his back 

(just as the wind diffuses fragrance) and did good with it (riches). I went along with him for some 

time when He said: Sit here. And he made me sit at a safe place and there were stones around it, and 

he said to me: Sit here till I come to you. He went away on the stony ground till I could not see him. 

He stayed away from me, and he prolonged his stay. Then I heard him as he came back and he was 

saying: Even if he committed theft and even if he committed fornication. When he came I could not 

help asking him: Apostle of Allah, let Allah make me ransom for you, whom were you speaking on 

the stony ground? I heard nobody responding to you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It was Gabriel who 

met me by the side of the stony ground and said: Give glad tidings to your Ummah that he who died 

without associating ought with Allah would go into Paradise. I said: Gabriel, even if he committed

worldly riches, and they know nothing. I said: What about you and your brothers Quraish? You do 

not go to thein for any need and do not accept anything from them. He said: By Allah, I neither beg 

anything from them (from worldly goods), nor do I ask them anything about religion till I meet my

ded (so deeply) that (the hot Iron) would come out of their sides, and when the backs of their necks 

would be branded, it would come out of their foreheads. He (Abu Dharr) then went away and sat 

down. I asked who he was. They said: He is Abu Dharr. I went to him and said to him: What is this

is one that a person spends on his family, and the dinar which he spends on his animal in Allah's

said: He (the narrator) started with family, and then Abu Qilaba said: Who is the person with greater 

reward than a person who spends on young members of his family (and thus) preserves (saves them

sessed the largest property and among his property he valued most was his garden known as Baira-

ha' which was opposite the mosque, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) often visi-

ted it and he drank of its sweet water. When this verse was revealed:" You will never attain righ-

teousness till you give freely of what you Have" (iii. 91), Abu Talha got up and, going to Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him), said: Allah says in His Book:" You will never attain righteousness 

till you give freely of what you love," and the dearest of my property is Bairaha' so I give it as Sadaqa 

to God from Whom I hope for reward for it and the treasure with Allah; so spend it, Messenger of 

Allah, on whatever purpose you deem it proper. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: Bravo I that is profit earning property. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should 

spend it on your nearest relatives. So Abu Talha distributed it among the neatest relatives and his 

cousins on his father's side.

Anas reported that when this verse was tevealed:" You will not attain righteousness till you give 

freely of what you love," Abu Talha said: I see that our Lord has demanded from us out of our pro-

perty; so I make you a witness, Messenger of Allah. that I give my land known as Bairaha' for the 

sake of Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Give that to your re-

latives. So he gave it to Hassan b. Thabit and Ubayy b. Ka'b.

So I went and there was another woman of the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

Book 005, Number 2211: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (tray peace be upon him) as saying: If anyone gives as Sa-

daqa the equivalent of a date from that (earning) earned honestly, for Allah accepts that which is la-

wful, the Lord would accept it with His Right Hand, and even if it is a date, it would foster in the 

Hand of the lord, as one of you fosters his colt, till it becomes bigger than a mountain.

rily I am aware of what you do" (xxiii. 51). And He said: ' 0 those who believe, eat of the good things 

that We gave you" (ii. 172) He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair dishe-

velled and covered with dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication):" O 

Lord,0 Lord," whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his 

nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?

there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords 

hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour 

of the face of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw 

them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce 

Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with 

his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur'an): '"0 people, fear your 

Lord, Who created you from a single being" to the end of the verse," Allah is ever a Watcher over 

you" (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:" Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that 

which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah" (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with 

one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some do-

nated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. 

Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely 

lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eata-

bles and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) glistening, like gold 

(on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who sets a good pre-

cedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who ac-

ted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam

And when the spender (and the other narrator said, when the giver of charity) makes up his mind to 

give charity, it (coat-mail) becomes expanded for him. But when a miserly person intends to spend, 

it contracts and every ring grips the place where it is. For the giver of charity, this coat-of. mail ex-

pands to cover his whole body and obliterates even his footprints. Abu Huraira said: (The miserly 

man) tries to expand it (the coat-of-mail) but it does not expand.

Book 005, Number 2228: 

Abu Haraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave similitudes of a

ves charity it (the coat-of mail) expands so much as to cover his finger tips and obliterate his foot 

prints. And whenever the miserly person intends to give charity (the coat-of-mail) contracts and 

every ring grips the place where it is. He (Abu Huraira) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

obliterated. And when the miserly man intends to give charity, it contracts over him, and his hands

morning, the people were talking and saying: charity was given to an adulteress last night. He (the 

giver of Sadaqa) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to an adulteress. He then again expressed his in-

tention to give charity; so he went out with the charity and placed it in the hand of a rich person. In 

the morning the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a rich person. He (the giver of 

charity) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to a well-to-do person. He then expressed his intention

people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a thief. So (one of the persons) said: 0 Allah, to 

Thee be the praise (what a misfortune it is that charity has been given to) the adulteress, to a rich 

person. to a thief! There came (the angel to him) and he was told: Your charity has been accepted. As

without any right, he is like one who eats and is not satisfied.

ment of the world? He said: Blessings (the natural resources) of the earth. They (again) said: Messen-

about to kill but (the animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it 

faces the sun, it chews the cud, it has dunged and urinated. it returns and eats. This wealth is green 

and sweet, and he who accepts it and applies it rightly, finds it a good help, but he who takes it 

wrongfully is like one who eats without being satisfied.

Abu Said al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting on the 

pulpit and we were sitting around him, and he said: What I am afraid of in regard to you after my 

death is that there would be opened for you the adornments of the world and its beauties. A person 

said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

remained   silent.   And   it   was   said   to   him   (the   man   who   had   asked   the   question   from   the   Holy 

Prophet): What Is the matter with you, that you speak with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) but he does not speak with you? We thought as if revelation was descending upon him. 

He regained himself and wiped the sweat from him and said: He was the inquirer (and his style of 

expression showed as if he praised him and then added): Verily good does not produce evil. Whate-

ver the spring rainfall causes to grow kills or is about to kill, but that (animal) which feeds on vege-

tation. It eats till its flanks are filled; it faces the sun and dungs and urinates. and then returns to eat. 

And this Wealth is a sweet vegetation, and it is a good companion for a Muslim who gives out of it to 

the needy, to the orphan. to the wayfarer, or something like that as the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

are called (for help). but the spoils are given to other people besides us. This (remark) reached him 

(the Holy Prophet). and he gathered them In a tent. and said: What is this news that has reached me 

on your behalf? They kept silence. Upon this he said: 0 people of Ansar, don't you like that people 

should go away with worldly (riches), and you go away with Muhammad taking him to your hou-

ses? They said: Yes, happy we are. Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: If the people were 

to tread a valley, and the Ansar were to tread a narrow path, I would take the narrow path of the 

Ansar. Hisham said: I asked Abu Hamza if he was present there. He said: How could Ibe absent from 

him?

Book 005, Number 2309: 

Anas b. Malik reported: We conquered Mecca and then we went on an expedition to Hunain. The 

polytheists came, forming themselves into the best rows that I have seen. They first formed the rows 

of cavalry, then those of infantry, and then those of women behind them. Then there were formed 

the rows of sheep and goats and then of other animals. We were also people large in number, and 

our (number) had reached six thousand. And on one side Khalid b. Walid was in charge of the ca-

valry. And our horses at once turned back from our rear. And we could hardly hold our own when 

our   horses   were   exposed,   and   the   bedouins   and   the   peoplewhom   we  knew   took  to   their   heels. 

(Seeing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called thus: 0 refugees,0 refugees. He 

then. said: 0 Ansar,0 Ansar. (Anas said: This hadith is transmitted by a group of eminent persons.) 

We said: At thy beck and call are we, Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) then advanced and he (Anas) said: By Allah, we had not yet reached them when Allah de-

feated them. and we took possession of the wealth and we then marched towards Ta'if, and we besie-

ged them for forty nights. and then came back to Mecca and encamped (at a place), and the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to bestow a hundred camels upon each individual. The 

rest of the hadith is the same.

Book 005, Number 2310: 

Rafi' b. Khadij reported that the Messenger of Allah; (may peace be upon him) gave to Abu Sufyan 

b. Harb and Saf wan. b. Umayya and 'Uyaina b. Hisn and Aqra' b. Habis, i. e. to every one of these 

persons, one hundred of camels, and gave to 'Abbas b. Mirdas less than this number. Upon this 'Ab-

bas b. Mirdis said:

You allot the share of my booty and that of my horse between 'Uyaina and Aqra'.

Both Uyaina and Aqra' are in no way more eminent than Mirdas (my father) in the assembly.

I am in no way inferior to any one of these persons.

And he who is let down today would not be elevated.

He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then completed one hun-

dred camels for him.

Abdullah b. Zaid reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) conquered 

Hunain he distributed the booty, and he bestowed upon those whose hearts it was intended to win. It 

was conveyed to him (the Holy Prophet) that the Ansar cherished a desire that they should be given 

(that very portion) which the people (of Quraish) had got. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) stood up and, after having praised Allah and lauded Him, addressed them thus: 

0 people of Ansar, did I not find you erring and Allah guided you aright through me, and (in the 

state of) being destitute and Allah made you free from want through me, and in a state of disunity 

and Allah united you through me, and they (the Ansar) said: Allah and His Messenger are most be-

nevolent. He (again) said: Why do you not answer me? They said: Allah and His Messenger are the 

most benevolent. He said, If you wish you should say so and so, and the event (should take) such and 

such course (and in this connection he made a mention) of so many things. 'Amr is under the im-

pression that he has not been able to remember them. He (the Holy Prophet) further said: Don't you 

feel happy (over this state of affairs) that the people should go away with goats and camels, and you 

go to your places along with the Messenger of Allah? The Ansar are inner garments (more close to 

me) and (other) people are outer garments. Had there not been migration, I would have been a man 

from among the Ansar. If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley 

(chosen) by the Ansar or narrow path (trodden) by them. And you would soon find after me prefe-

rences (over you in getting material benefits). So you should show patience till you meet me at the 

Haud (Kauthar).

Book 005, Number 2314: 

Abdullah reported: On the day of Hunain, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sho-

wed preference (to some) People in the distribution of the spoils. He bestowed on Aqra' b. Habis one 

hundred camels, and bestowed an equal (number) upon 'Uyaina, and bestowed on people among the 

elites of Arabia, and pre. ferred them) (to others) on that day, in the distribution (of spoils). Upon this 

a person said: By Allah, neither justice has been done In this distribution (of spoils), nor has the plea-

sure of Allah been sought in it. I (the Narrator ) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) about it. so I came to him and informed him about what he had 

said. - The colour of his (the Prophet's) face changed red like blood and he then said: Who would do 

justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice? He further said: May Allah have mercy upon

Jabir b. Abdullah reported that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

at Jirana on his way back from Hunain, and there was in the clothes of Bilal some silver. The Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took a handful out of that and bestowed it upon the people. 

He (the person who had met the Prophet at Ji'rana) said to him: Muhammad, do justice. He (the Holy 

Prophet) said: Woe be upon thee, who would do justice if I do not do justice, and you would be very 

unfortunate and a loser if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) 

said: Permit me to kill this hypocrite. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: May there be protection 

of Allah! People would say that I kill my companions. This man and his companions would recite the 

Qur'an but it would not go beyond their throat, and they swerve from it just as the arrow goes

peace be upon him) said: I have done it with a view to con- cillating them. Then there came a person 

with thick beard, prominent cheeks, deep sunken eyes and protruding forehead and shaven head. He 

said: Muhammad, fear Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If I di-

sobey Allah, who would then obey Him? Have I not been (sent as the) most trustworthy among the 

people of the-world? -but you do not repose trust in me. That person then went back. A person 

among the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to 

some, it was Khalid b. Walid who sought the permission. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him), said: From this very person's posterity there would arise people who would recite 

the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throat; they would kill the followers of Islam and would 

spare the idol-worshippers. They would glance through the teachings of Islam so hurriedly just as 

the arrow passes through the pray. If I were to ever find them I would kill them like 'Ad.

Book 005, Number 2319: 

Abu Said al-Khudri reported: 'Ali b. Abu Talib sent to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) from Yemen some gold alloyed with clay in a leather bag dyed in the leaves of Mimosa flava. 

He distributed it among four men. 'Uyaina b. Hisna, Aqra' b. Habis and Zaid al-Khail, and the fourth 

one was either Alqama b. 'Ulatha or 'Amir b. Tufail. A person from among his (Prophet's) Compan-

ions said: We had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons). This (remark) reached the 

Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) upon which he said: Will you not trust me, whereas I am a 

trustee of Him Who is in the heaven? The news come to me from the heaven morning and evening. 

Then there stood up a person with deep snnken eyes, prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, 

thick beard, shaven head, tucked up loin cloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah. He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: Woe to thee. do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth? 

That man then returned. Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck? 

Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the prayer. Khalid said: How 

many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon 

this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have not been commanded to pierce 

through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was 

going back. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of 

this (man) who would recite the Qur'an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats; they would 

(hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow passes through the prey. I 

conceive that he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find them I would certainly kill them as were 

killed the (people of) Thamud.

neck? Upon this he said: No. Then he turned away, and Khalid the Sword of Allah stood up against 

him, and said: Prophet of Allah. shall I not strike off his neck? He said, No, and then said: A people 

would rise from his progeny who would recite the Book of Allah glibly and fluently. 'Umar said: I

Sai'd al-Khudri) said: I don't know who the Haruriya are, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) as saying: There would arise in this nation (and he did not say" out of them" ) a 

people and you would hold insignificant your prayers as compared with their prayers. And they 

would recite the Qur'an which would not go beyond their throats and would swerve through the re-

ligion (as blank) just as a (swift) arrow passes through the prey. The archer looks at his arrow, at its 

iron head and glances at its end (which he held) in the tip of his fingers to see whether it had any 

stain of blood.

Abu Sai'd al-Khudri reported: When we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) and he was distributing the spoils of war, there came to him Dhul-Khuwasira, one 

of Banu Tamim. He said: Messenger of Allah, do justice. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) said: Woe be upon thee I Who would do justice, if I do not do justice? You would be 

unsuccessful and incurring a loss, if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased 

with him) said: Messenger of Allah, permit me to strike off his neck. The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said: Leave him, for he has friends (who would outwardly look to be so religious 

and pious) that everyone among you would consider his prayer insignificant as compared with their 

prayer, and his fast as com- pared with their fasts. They would recite the Qur'an but it would not go 

beyond their collar-bones. They would pass through (the teachings of Islam so hurriedly) just as the 

arrow passes through the prey. He would look at its Iron head, but would not find anything ticking) 

there. He would then see at the lowest end, but would not find anything sticking there. He would 

then see at its grip but would not find anything sticking to it. He would then see at its feathers and he 

would find nothing sticking to them (as the arrow would pass so quickly that nothing would stick to 

it) neither excrement nor blood. They would be recognised by the presence of a black man among 

them whose upper arms would be like a woman's breast, or like a piece of meat as it quivers, and

they would come forth at the time when there is dissension among the people. Abu Sai'd said: I testify 

to the fact that I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and I testify to the 

fact that 'Ali b. Abu Talib fought against them and I was with him. He gave orders about that man 

who was sought for, and when he was brought in, and when I looked at him, he was exactly as the

distinctive mark would be shaven heads. They would be the worst creatures or the worst of the crea-

tures. The group who would be nearer to the truth out of the two would kill them. The Apostle of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him) gave an example (to give their description) or he said: A man throws 

an arrow at the prey (or he said at the target), and sees at its iron head, but finds no sign (of blood 

there), or he sees at the lowest end, but would not see or find any sign (of blood there). He would 

then see into the grip but would not find (anything) sticking to it. Abu Sai'd then said: People of Iraq. 

it is you who have killed them.

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: A group

anything to him (the Holy Prophet) which he never said. When I talk to you of anything which is 

between me and you (there might creep some error in it) for battle is an outwitting. I heard the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people 

who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if 

their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go

Zaid b. Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall under the command of 

Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khwarij. 'Ali (Allah be 

pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: The-

re would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur'an, and your recital would seem 

insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your 

fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur'an thinking that it sup- ports them, 

whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they 

would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to 

encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Apostle (may pe-

ace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good de-

eds), and their (that of the Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person 

whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the 

breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the peo-

ple of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). 

By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and 

get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in 

the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me 

alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. 'Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the 

Khwarij when we encountered them. He ('Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw 

out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the 

day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought 

against them  with spears and they were killed one after  another. Only  two persons  were killed 

among the people (among the army led by Hadrat 'Ali) on that day. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) 

said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed). They searched but 

did not find him. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to 

the people who had been killed one after another. He ('Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then 

('Ali's companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He (Hadrat 'Ali) then 

pronounced Allah-O-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) conveyed it. Then there stood before him 'Abida Salmani who said: 

Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you 

heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: Yes, by Allah, besi-

their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his 

throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah us one black man among them (Khwarij). One 

of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When 'Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be plea-

not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spo-

ken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. 'Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the 

dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat 'Ali). 'Ubai-

so but out of jealousy that you nurse against us By Allah, you became the son-in-law of the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) but we felt no jealousy against you (for this great privilege of 

yours). 'Ali then said: Send them (if you like). They set out and 'Ali lay on the bed. When the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) offered the noon prayer. we went ahead of him to his apart-

ment and stood near it till he came out. He took hold of our ears (out of love and affection) and then

BOOK 06: THE BOOK OF FASTING (KITAB AL-SAWM)

Introduction 

After prayer the second obligatory duty which every Muslim is required toper- form is that of fas-

ting during the month of Ramadan. The word sawm which has been used in the Holy Qur'an and the 

Hadith for fasting means" to abstain" ; thus a horse that abstains from moving about or from eating 

the fodder is said to be sa'im. In the technical language sawm signifies fasting or abstaining from 

food and drink and sexual intercourse from the dim beginning of dawn till sunset. 

Fasting as an institution for the purification of the soul is common to all Divine religions. The wri-

ter of the article on" Fasting" in the Encyclopadia Britannica states that" it would be difficult to name 

any religious system of any description in which it is wholly unrecognized." This institution was well 

established among the Jews and the Christians. 

The records of the Hadith bear ample testimony to the fact that fasting was a common religious 

practice among the pre-Islamic Arabs too, and they used to observe fast on the tenth of Muharram 

because it was on this very day that Allah saved Moses and his companions from the clutches of the 

Pharaoh who was drowned in the sea along with his army. The Arabs and other people too were fa-

miliar with fasting as an act of penitence or of propitiation or a preparatory rite before some act of 

sacramental eating or an initiation or a mourning ceremony. 

In Islam fasting is primarily an institution for a spiritual discipline and selfcontrol. It is in fact an 

exercise in religious devotion in the form of cheerful and willing renunciation, for a definite period, 

of all the appetites of flesh lawful in themselves (the unlawful ones being ruled out of course). The 

Qur'an says: 

0 ye who believe! prescribed unto you is fasting even as it was prescribed unto those before you. 

that haply you may become God-conscious (ii. 183). 

Of all the creation of God only man deviates from His path. We will find that two things are main-

ly responsible for this: the love for material possessions and the tempta- tions of the flesh. Islam has, 

through the institutions of Zakat and Sadaqat, purged the hearts of its followers from the love of we-

alth, and has inculcated in him the habit to part with it readily for the sake of God. 

Fasting has been ordained as a religious duty for the Muslims for subduing their lust and keeping 

their appetites well within reasonable bounds so that man may not become their slave and lose con-

trol over himself. The Qur'an clearly states that a man cannot attain salvation unless he learns to res-

train his self from low desires." And as for him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains him-

self from low desires, Paradise is surely the abode" (lxxix. 40-41). 

The exercise of abstaining from things otherwise lawful in the ordinary course of life, at the behest 

of Allah, strengthens man's morality and self-control and deepens in him the consciousness of the 

Lord. This is what distinguishes fasting in Islam from fasting in other religions. 

599 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 06: THE BOOK OF FASTING (KITAB AL-SAWM)

It should also be borne in mind that fasting does not aim at inflicting punishment upon people or 

sadding upon them unbearable burdens. The underlying idea behind it is to teach moderation and 

spiritual discipline so that human temptations may not become so wild and uncontrollable as to flout 

the commands of the Great Master. To be a true servant of Allah, it is essential that man should be 

able to conform his behaviour to the moral and spiritual discipline embodied in the Shari'ah of Islam. 

One cannot achieve this end if one finds oneself helpless before untamed and turbulent desires. Fas-

ting is indispensable for this moral and spiritual training. 

Another distinguishing feature of Islamic fasting is that it does not train a person for complete 

renunication but for perfect and cheerful obedience to the Lord All those things from which man is 

commanded to abstain during fast, e. g. eating, drinking and sexual intercourse, become permissible 

for him at the end of the fast. This shows that Islam does not look down upon the appetite of flesh as 

something ignoble and thus fit to be exterminated root and branch from the human soul. According 

to Islam, there is nothing profane or ignoble in human personality: both soul and body are sacred 

and worthy of respect. No aspect is to be ignored and no urge is to be completely curbed. What is re-

quired is to keep all these urges well within their proper limits so that none of them transgresses na-

tural bounds and becomes the source of trouble. 

That fasting is an institution for moral elevation can be judged from the fact that Allah does not 

impose check only upon eating, drinking and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset, but also ex-

horts His servants to refrain from other foul acts, for ex- ample, backbiting, indulging in foul speech, 

telling lies, etc. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If one 

does not abandon falsehood and other actions like it, God has no need that one should abandon one's 

food and drink (Sahih Bukhari). 

The social aspect of fasting in Ramadan is that the whole atmosphere is permeated with religious 

piety and devotion to Allah. There is one extra congregational prayer, Tarawih, during the night, in 

which the Qur'an is recited and the Muslim is reminded of the fact that it was in the month of Ra-

madan that the revelation of the Qur'an commenced. The sadaqqt are also given with greater zeal 

and fervour in this month. Thus the whole Muslim society is inspired by the love of God. Abu Hurai-

ra reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When Ramadan begins, the gates 

of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are locked, and the devils are chained (Bukhari and Muslim). 

Muhammad Asad, while elucidating the spiritual and moral significance of fast says:" Twofold I 

learned, is the purpose of this month of fasting. One has to abstain from food and drink in order to 

feel in one's body what the poor and hungry feel: thus social responsibility is being hammered into 

human consciousness as a religious postulate. The other purpose of fasting during Ramadan is self-

discipline, an aspect of individual morality strongly accentuated in all Islamic teachings (as, for in-

stance, in the total prohibition of all intoxicants, which Islam regards as too easy an avenue of escape 

from consciousness and responsibility). In these two elements-brotherhood of man and Individual 

self-discipline -I began to discern nhe outline of Islam's ethical out look" (Road to Mecca, London, 

1954, p. 188).

fast till we complete thirty (lasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sightidg of 

the moon by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) has commanded us. Yahya b. Yahya was in doubt (whether the word used in the nar-

ration by Kuraib) was Naktafi or Taktafi.

Chapter 6: It is immaterial whether the new moon is 

large (on account of appearing after thirty nights) 

or small (on account of appearing on the thirtieth 

night); and Allah defers it to make it suitable for 

sighting and if the sky is cloudy, then thirty (fasts) 

are to be completed 

Book 006, Number 2392: 

Abu'l-Bakhtari reported: We went out to perform Umra and when we encamped in the valley of 

Nakhla, we tried to see the new moon. Some of the people said: It was three nights old, and others 

(said) that it was two nights old. We then met Ibn 'Abbas and told him we had seen the new moon, 

but that some of the people said it was three nights old and others that it was two nights old. He as-

ked on which night we had seen it; and when we told him we had seen it on such and such night, he 

said the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said: Verily Allah deferred it till the time it is 

seen, so it is to be reckoned from the night you saw it.

Book 006, Number 2393: 

Abu'l-Bakhtari reported: We saw the new moon of Ramadan as we were at Dhit-i-'Irq. We sent a

moon had something of the nature of defect in it). Upon this Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with both

Chapter 8: The timing of fast begins with dawn 

Book 006, Number 2396: 

'Adi b. Hatim (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when (this verse) was revealed:" Until the 

white streak of the dawn becomes distinct from the dark streak" (ii. 187) Adi b. Hatim said: Messen-

ger of Allah, verily I keep underneath my pillow two strings, one white and the other black, by 

which I distinguish night from dawn. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: Your pillow seems to be very large. For the word khait implies the blackness of the night and 

the whiteness of the dawn.

Book 006, Number 2397: 

Sahl b. Sa'd said that when this verse was revealed:" Eat and drink till the white streak is distinct 

from the dark streak," a person would take hold of a white thread and a black thread and keep on 

eating till he could find them distinct (in the light of the dawn). It was then that Allah, the Majestic 

and Great, reveiled (the words) min al-fajr (from the dawn), and then it became clear (that the word 

khait refers to the streak of light in the dawn).

Book 006, Number 2398: 

Sahl b. Sa'd (Allah be pleased with him) said: When this verse was reveal- ed." Eat and drink till 

the white streak becomes distinct from the dark streak for you," the person who decided to observe 

fast tied on one of his feet a black thread and on the other a white thread. And he went on eating and 

drinking till he could distinguish (between their colour) on seeing them. It was after this that Allah 

reveal- ed (the words): min al-fajr. And they (the Muslims) came to know that (the word khait) re-

fers to the night and day.

Book 006, Number 2399: 

'Abdullah b. Mas'ud (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace

Maktum (which was pro- nounced at the conclusion of the Sahri and the commencement of the 

fast).

Book 006, Number 2400: 

Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) as saying: Bilal announces Adhan during the night, so you eat and drink, 

till you hear the Adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum.

lah (may peace be upon him) said: Bilal announces Adhan at (the fag end of the) night (i. e. Sahri), so 

eat and drink till the son of Umm Maktum announces Adhan. And he (the narrator) said: And the 

(difference of time) between their (Adhans) was not more than this that one climbed down (from the 

minaret) and the other climbed up (to announce Adhan).

Ibn Mas'ud (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as 

saying The Adhan of Bilal should not restrain anyone among you from eating Sahur (last meal before 

daybreak during the month of Ramadan) for he announces Adhan (or he calls) at (the fag end of) the 

night to make him turn who stands for prayer among you, and to awaken those who are sleeping 

among you. And he said: The dawn is not like it, as one says (and he lifted his hand) till he (dispersed 

his fingers) and said: It is like this.

Book 006, Number 2405: 

This hadith has been narrated by Sulaiman al-Taimi with the same chain of transmitters (but with 

a slight variation of words) that he (the Holy Prophet) said: The dawn is not like it as it is said; he

then gathered his fingers and lowered them. But he said, it is like this (and he placed the index finger 

upon the other one and spread his hand).

Book 006, Number 2406: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman Taimi with the same chain of trans-

mitters and, at the end, it was said that the first Adhan was meant to awaken those who were in 

slumber amongst them and in order to make them turn who stand in (prayer) among them (towards 

food at the commencement of the fast). Jarir (one of the narrators) said that the Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) did not say like this but he said like it (true dawn) that the streaks of (true dawn ) 

are horizontal and not vertical.

Book 006, Number 2407: 

Samura b. Jandub reported Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as saying. The call of Bilal may 

not mislead any one of you (and he may, under the wrong impression gathered from it, refrain) from 

taking meal before the commencement of the fast (for the streaks) of this whiteness (which are verti-

cal indicate the false dawn and the true dawn with which the fast commences is that when the stre-

aks of light are) spread.

Book 006, Number 2408: 

Samura b. Jundub reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Adhan of 

Bilal should not mislead you nor the whiteness (of the pillar) of dawn, for it is not the whiteness of 

the true dawn, but that of the false dawn which is vertical like a pillar and you can eat food till the 

streaks of whiteness spread like it.

Book 006, Number 2409: 

Samura b. Jundub (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) as saying: The Adhan of Bilal may not mislead you with regard to your food at the commence-

ment of the fast, nor the vertical (streaks) of whiteness in the horizon (for it is an indication of false 

dawn). You should stop eating (food) till (the whiteness) spreads like it. Hammad narrated it and

got down and prepared the meal of parched barley and offered him, and the apostle of Allah (may

that he (the person) had said: Messenger of Allah, (the time) of prayer overtakes me as I am in a state 

of junub; should I observe fast (in this state)? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon

(in that very state), whereupon he said: Messenger of Allah, you are not like us Allah has pardoned 

all your sins, the previous ones and the later ones. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I 

hope I am the most God-fearirg of you, and possess the best knowledge among you of those (things) 

against which I should guard.

account of intercourse at night), and then observed fast.

for prayer, and observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is multiplied ten times 

and this is like fasting for ever. I said: Messenger of Allah. I am capable of doing more than this. The-

reupon he said: Fast one day and do not fast for the next two days. I said: Messenger of Allah, I have

break on the other day. That is known as the fasting of David (peace be upon him) and that is the

Yahya reported: I and 'Abdullah b. Yazid set out till we came to Abu Salama. We sent a messenger 

to him (in his house in order to inform him about our arrival) and he came to us. There was a mos-

que near the door of his house, and we were in that mosque, till he came out to us. He said: If you 

like you may enter (the house) and, if you like, you may sit here (in the mosque). We said: We would 

rather sit here and (you) relate to us. He (Yahya) then narrated that 'Abdullah b Amr b. al-'As (Allah 

be pleased with them) told him: I used to observe fast uninterruptedly and recited the (whole of the) 

Qur'an every night. It (the uninterrupted fasting and recital of the Qur'in every night) was mentio-

ned to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) or he sent for me, and I went to him and he said 

to me: I have been informed that you fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur'An) every 

night. I said: Apostle of Allah, it is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good, whereupon he said: It 

suffices for you that you should observe fast for three days during every mouth. I said: Apostle of Al-

lah, I am capable of doing more than this. He said: Your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a 

right upon you, your body has a right upon you; so observe the fast of David, the Apostle of Allah 

(peace be upon him), for he was the best worshipper of Allah. I said: Apostle of Allah, what is the fast 

of David? He said: He used to fast one day and did not fast the other day. He (also) said: Recite the 

Qur'an during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this, whereu-

pon he said: Recite it in twenty days; recite it in ten days. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, 

whereupon he said: Recite it every week, and do not exceed beyond this, for your wife has a right 

upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you. He ('Amr b. 'As) said: I 

was hard to myself and thus I was put to hardship. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

had told me: 'You do not know you may live long (thus and bear the hardships for a long time), and I 

accepted that which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told me. When I grew old I 

wished I had availed myself of the conces- sion (granted by) the Apostle of Allah (may-peace be

ters and he made this addition after these words: During every month, (fasting) for three days, there 

is for you ten times for every good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a reward 

for full thirty days). I said: What is the fast of the Apostle of Allah, David? He said: Half of the age 

(observing fast on alternate days for the whole life). And in the hadith no mention has been made of 

the recital of the Qur'an, and he did not say: Your visitor has a right upon you, but (instead) he said: 

Your son has a right upon you.

'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be

Abdu'llah b. 'Amr b. 'As (Allah be pleased with them) reported: It was conveyed to the Apostle of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) that I observe fast succes- sively and pray during the whole night. 

He sent for me or I met him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It has been conveyed to me that you ob-

serve fast continuously and do not break it and pray during the whole night. Don't do that. for there 

is share for your eyes, share for your own self, share for your family; so observe fast and break it, 

pray and sleep and observe fast for one day during the ten days, and there is a reward for you (for 

other) nine (days besides the tenth day of the fast). I said: Apostle of Allah, I find myself more power-

ful than this. He said: Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). He ('Amr) said: Apostle of 

Allah, how did David observe fast? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He used to fast one day and break it 

on the other day, and he did not run (from the battlefield) as he encountered (the enemy). He said: 

Apostle of Allah, who can guarantee this for me (will I also encounter the enemy dauntlessly)? 'Ata', 

the narrator of the hadith, said: I do not know how there (crept in) the matter of perpetual fast. The 

Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, said: He who observed perpetual fast did not 

fast at all; he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all, he who observed perpetual fast did not 

fast at all. This hadith has been narrated by Ibn Juraij with the same chain of transmitters. Imam 

Muslim has narrated this hadith on the authority of Abu 'Abbas al-Sa'ib b. Farrukh and he was a 

trustworthy and reliable (narrator) among the people of Mecca.

There is no (reward for) fasting (for him) who fasts perpetually. Fasting for three days during the

(Lailat-ul-Qadr) but I forgot it (the exact night) ; so seek it;In the last ten nights on odd numbers. I 

saw (the glimpses of that dream) that I was prostrating in water and mud. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: 

It rained on the twenty-first night and the water dripped (from the roof) of the mosque at the place 

where the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed prayer. I looked at him and as he 

completed the dawn prayer, (I found) his face was wet with mud and water.

Book 006, Number 2626: 

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) devoted (himself to prayer) in the middle (ten nights) of Ramadan. The rest of the ha-

dith is the same except for these words:" That he adhered to his place of i'tikaf and his forehead was 

besmeared with mud and water."

Book 006, Number 2627: 

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) observed i'tikaf (confined himself for devotion and prayer) in the first ten (days) of Ra-

madan; he then observed i'tikaf in the middle ten (days) in a Turkish tent with a mat hanging at its 

door. He (the Holy Prophet) took hold of that mat and placed it in the nook of the tent. He then put 

his head out and talked with people and they came near him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: I obser-

ved i'tikaf in the first ten (nights and days) in order to seek that night (Lailat-ul-Qadr). I then obser-

ved i'tikaf in the middle ten days. Then (an angel) was sent to me and I was told that this (night) is 

among the last ten (nights). He who among you likes to observe i'tikaf should do so; and the people 

observed it along with him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: That (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was shown to me 

on an odd (night) and I (saw in the dream) that I was prostrating in the morning in clay and water. 

So in the morning of the twenty-first night when he (the Holy Prophet) got up for dawn (prayer). 

there was a rainfall and the mosque dripped, and I saw clay and water. When he came out after 

completing the morning prayer (I saw) that his forehead and the tip of his nose had (traces) of clay 

and water, and that was the twenty-first night among the last ten (nights).

Abu Salama reported: 'We discussed amongst ourselves Lailat-ul-Qadr. I came to Abu Sa'id al-

Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) who was a friend of mine and said to him: Would you not go 

with us to the garden of date trees? He went out with a cloak over him. I said to him: Did you hear 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) making mention of Lailat-ul-Qadr? He said: Yes, 

(and added) we were observing i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the 

middle ten days of Ramadan, and came out on the morning of the twentieth and the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) addressed us and said: I was shown Lailat-ul-Qadr, but I forgot (the 

exact night) or I was caused to forget it, so seek it in the last ten odd (nights), and I was shown that I 

was prostrating in water and clay. So he who wanted to observe i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah 

(inay peace be upon him) should return (to the place of i'tikaf). He (Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) said: And 

we returned and did not find any patch of cloud in the sky. Then the cloud gathered and there was 

(so heavy) a downpour that the roof of the mosque which was made of the branches of date-palms 

began to drip. Then there was prayer and I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

prostrating in water and clay till I saw the traces of clay on his forehead.

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be

made manifest to him. When (these nights) were over, he commanded to strike the tent. Then it was 

made manifest to him that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was in the last ten nights (of Ramadan), and commanded 

to pitch the tent (again). He then came to the people and said: O people, Lailat-ul-Qadr was made 

manifest to me and I came out to inform you about it that two persons came contend- ing with each 

other and there was a devil along with them and I forgot it. So seek it in the last ten nights of Rama-

dan. Seek it on the ninth, on the seventh and on the fifth. I (one of the narrators) said: Abu Sa'id, you 

know more than us about numbers. He said: Yes, indeed we have better right than you. I said: What 

is this ninth, seventh, and fifth? He said: When twenty-one (nights are over) and the twenty-second 

begins, it is the ninth, and when twenty-three (nights) are over, that which follows (the last night) is 

the seventh, and when twenty-five nights are over, what follows it is fifth. Ibn Khallad said: Instead 

of the word Yahliqan (contending), he said Yakhtasiman, (they are disputing).

Introduction 

The word Hajj means, literally, repairing to a place for the sake of visit (al-qasd li-ziyarah), and in 

the terminology of the Islamic Shari'ah, it implies the repairing to Bait-Allah (the house of Allah) to 

observe the necessary devotion (iqamat-an-li-nusuk) Bait-Allah is one of the names by which the 

Ka'ba is called. 

Hajj is not a new institution which Islam has introduced in its Shari'ah. This institution is as old as 

the Ka'ba itself which is called in the Holy Qur'an to be" the first House of Divine Worship appointed 

for men" (iii. 95). This verse of the Holy Qur'an corroborates the hadith which tells us that the Ka'ba 

was first built by Adam, the first man upon the earth. It was later on rebuilt by Hadrat Ibrahim and 

his illustrious son Hadrat Isma'il (peace be upon both of them). And when Ibrahim and Isma'al raised 

the foundations of the house, they said:" Our Lord! accept from us" (ii. 127). An earlier revelation 

makes it clear that the Ka'ba was already there when Hadrat Ibrahim left Hadrat Isma'il in the wil-

derness of Arabia:" Our Lord! I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit 

near Thy sacred House" (xiv. 37). 

The whole ceremony of Hajj is commemorative of Hadrat Ibrahim and his family's acts of devotion 

to God Almighty. This shows that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) did not innovate this 

institution but purged it of all evil practices and made it an obligatory act of piety by which one can 

develop God-consciousness. 

It is rightly said that it is the perfection of faith since it combines in itself all the distinctive quali-

ties of other obligatory acts. It represents the quality of salat since a pilgrim offers prayers in the Ka'-

ba, the House of the Lord. It encourages the spending of material wealth for the sake of the Lord, the 

chief characteristic of Zakat. When a pilgrim sets out for Hajj, he dissociates himself from his hearth 

and home, from his dear and near ones to please the Lord. He suffers privation and undertakes the 

hardship of journey-the lessons we learn from fasting and i'tikaf. In Hajj one is trained to be comple-

tely forgetful of the material comforts and show of worldly thing. One has to sleep on stony ground, 

circumambulate the Ka'ba, run between Safa and Marwa and spend his night and day wearing, only 

two pieces of unsewn cloth. He is required to avoid the use of oil or scent or any other perfume. He is 

not even allowed to get his hair cut or trim his beard. In short, he is commanded to abandon every-

thing for the sake of Allah and submit himself before his Lord, the ultimate aim of the life of a Mus-

lim. In fact, physical pilgrimage is a prelude to spiritual pilgrimage to God, when man would bid 

goodbye to everything of the world and present himself before Him as His humble servant saying:" 

Here I am before Thee, my Lord, as a slave of Thine." 

"Down through the ages." says Professor Hitti, "this institution has continued to serve as the major 

unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond among the diverse believers. It ren-

dered almost every capable Moslem perforce a traveller for once in his lifetime. The socializing in-

fluence of such a gathering of the brotherhood of believers from the far quarters of the earth is hard

to overestimate. It afforded opportunity for negroes, Berbers, Chinese, Persians, Syrians, Turks-rich 

and poor, high and low-to fraternize and meet together on the common ground of faith" (History of 

the Arabs, p. 136). 

Chapter 1: What is permitted for the muhrim (wearer 

of ihram) in Hajj and Umra, what is not permissible 

and forbiddance of the use of perfume 

Book 007, Number 2647: 

Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) what a Muhrim should put on as dress. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) said: Do not put on a shirt or a turban, or trousers or a cap, or leather stockings 

except one who does not find shoes; he may put on stockings but he should trim them below the an-

kles. And do not wear clothes to which saffron or wars is applied.

Book 007, Number 2648: 

Salim reported on the authority of his father ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) that the Apostle of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) was asked what a Muhrim should wear, whereupon he said: A Muhrim should 

not wear a shirt, or a turban, or a cap, or trousers, or a cloth touched with wars or with saffron, nor 

(should he wear) stock- ings, but in case he does not find shoes, but (before wearing stockings) be 

should trim them (in such a way) that these should become lower than the ankles.

Book 007, Number 2649: 

Ibn 'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forbade the Muhrim to 

put on a cloth dyed in saffron or wars and he further said: One who does not find shoes (to wear) he 

way wear stockings, but (only) after trimming them below the ankles.

Book 007, Number 2650: 

Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) say as he was delivering an address: So far as the trousers are concerned, one who does 

not find lower garment, he may wear them; as also socks, he may wear them who does not find 

shoes. It concerns the Muhrim.

been putting on a cloak which was perfumed, or he (the narrator) said: There was a trace of yellow-

ness on it. He said (to the Holy Prophet): What do you command me to do during my Umra? (It was 

at this juncture) that the revelation came to the Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon him) and he 

was covered with a cloth, and Ya'la said: Would that I see revelation coming to the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace be upon him). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: Would it please you to see the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations 'Umar lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at 

him and he was emitting a sound of snorting. He (the narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a 

camel. When he was relieved of this he said: Where is he who asked about Umra? When the person 

came, the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the trace of yellowness, or he said: 

the trace of perfume and put off the cloak and do in your 'Umra what you do in your Hajj.

(this cloak) is upon me and I am perfumed. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to 

him: What would you do in your Hajj? He said: I would take off the clothes and would wash from

your Hajj do it in your Umra.

Book 007, Number 2656: 

Safwan b. Ya'la b. Umayya reported that Ya'la used to say to 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased 

with him): Would that I see revelation descending upon the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon 

him). (Once) when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in Ji'rana and there was a 

cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his Companions with him. 'Umar being one of 

them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messen-

ger of Allah, what about the person who, entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daub- 

ing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) looked at him for a short while, 

and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and 'Umar gestured (with his 

hand) to Ya'la b Umayya to come. Ya'la came and he enter- ed his head (beneath the cloth and saw) 

the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) with his face red, and breathing with a snore. Then he 

felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra? 

The man was searched for and he was brought, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was 

sewn) and do in 'Umra as you do in Hajj.

Book 007, Number 2657: 

Ya'la b. Umayya (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a person came to the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) as he was staying at Ji'rana and he had put on Ihram for 'Umra and he had 

dyed his beard and his head with yellow colour and there was a cloak on him. He said: I put on Ih-

ram for 'Umra and I am in this state as you see (with dyed beard and head and a cloak over me). He 

(the Holy Prophet) said: Take off the cloak and wash the yellowness and do in your 'Umra what you 

do in Hajj.

Book 007, Number 2658: 

Ya'la reported: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that a person came 

to him with a cloak on him having the traces of scent. He said, Messenger of Allah, I put on Ihram 

for 'Umra: what should I do? He (the Holy Prophet) kept quiet and did not make him any reply. And 

'Umar screened him and it was (usual) with 'Umar that when the revelation descended upon him, he 

provided him shade (with the help of a piece of cloth). I (the person who came to the Holy Prophet) 

said: I said to 'Umar I wish to project my head into the cloth (to see how the Holy Prophet receives 

revelation). So when the revelation began to descend upon him 'Umar wrapped him (the Holy Pro-

phet) with cloth I came to him and projected my head with him into the cloth, and saw him (the 

Holy Prophet) (receiving the revelation). When he (the Holy Prophet) was relieved (of its burden), he

the two pillars situated on the side of yaman (south), and I find you wearing the sandals of tanned 

leather, and I find you with dyed beard and head, and I also found that, when you were at Mecca, 

the people pronounced Talbiya as they saw the new moon (Dhu'l-Hijja), but you did not do it till the

ned, I did not see the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) touching them but only those si-

tuated on the side of yaman. (So far asthe wearing of) the shoes of tanned leather is concerned, I saw

persons who put on Ibrim for gajj, and 1 was one of those who put on Ihram for Umra. We went on 

till we reached Mecca, and on the day of 'Arafa I found myself In a state of menses, but I did not put 

off the Ihram for Umra. I told about (this state of mine) to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon 

him). whereupon he said: Abandon your 'Umra, and undo the hair of your head and comb (them), 

and put on Ihram for Hajj 'she ('A'isha) said: I did accordingly. When it was the night at Hasba and 

Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj, he (the Holy Prophet) sent with me Abd al-Rahman b. Abu 

Bakr, and he mounted me behind him on his camel and took me to Tan'im and I put on Ihram for 

'Umra, and thus Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and Umra and (we wore required to observe) 

neither sacrifice nor alms nor fasting.

Book 007, Number 2769: 

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: We set out with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

that of performing the Hajj, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He 

who among you intends to put on Ihram for 'Umra should do so for 'Umra. The rest of the badith is 

the same.

Book 007, Number 2770: 

A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We went with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

put on Ihram for Umra, and those also who had put on Ihram both for Hajj and Umra, and still those 

who had put on Ihram for Hajj (alone). I was one of those who had put on Ihram for. Umra (only). 

'Urwa (one of the narrators) said: Allah enabled her (Hdrat A'isha) to complete both Hajj and Umra

sacrificial animal nor (was she required to) fast, nor (was she obliged to give) alms.

who had put on Ihram for Hajj (only), while the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had

tered in the state of menses. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to me and I was 

weeping, whereupon he said: Are you in a state of menses? I said. Yes. whereupon he said: This is 

what Allah has ordained for all the daughters, of Adam. Do whatever the pilgrim does. except that 

you should not circumambulate the House till you have washed yourself (at the end of the menses 

period). And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) offered sacrifice of a cow on behalf of

A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We went with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

entered in the state of menses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to me while I 

was weeping. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Would that I had not come (for Pilgrimage) this 

year. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you? You have perhaps entered the period of 

menses. I said: Yes. He said: This is what has been ordained for the daughters of Adam. Do what a 

pilgrim does except that you should not circumambu- late the House, till you are purified (of the 

menses). She ('A'isha) said: When I came to Mecca, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said to his companions: Make this (Ihram) the Ihram for 'Umra. So the people put off Ihbaim except 

those who had sacrificial animals with them. She ('A'isha) said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) had the sacrificial animal with him, and so had Abd Bakr, 'Umar and other persons of 

means. They (those who had put off lhram again) put on Ihram (for Hajj) when they marched (to-

wards Mina), and it was the 8th of Dhu'I-Hijja. She ('A'isha) said: When it was the day of sacrifice 

(10th of Dhu'I-Hijia), I was purified, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) comman-

ded me and I did the circumambulation of Ifada. She said that the flesh of cow was sent to us. I said: 

What is It? They said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has offered cow as sacrifice 

on behalf of his wives. When it was the might at Hasba, I said: Messenger of Allah, people are co-

ming back from Hajj and Umra, where as I am coming back from Hajj (alone). She (IA'isha) reported: 

He (the Holy Prophet) commanded" Abd al- Rahman b. Abu Bakr to mount me upon his camel be-

hind him. She ('A'isha) said: I was very young and I well remember that I dozed oil and my face tou-

ched the bind part of the haudaj (camel litter) till we came to Tan'im, and entered into the state of 

Ihram in lieu of Umra (which I for the time being abandoned) and which the people had performed.

I was weeping. The rest of the hadith is the same but (with this portion) that there were sacrificial 

animals with Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and with Abu Bakr, Umar and with rich per-

sons. And they pro- nounced Talbiya as they proceeded on. And there is no mention of this (too):" I

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We proceeded with the Mes- senger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) putting on the Ihram for Hajj during the months of Hajj and the night of Hajj till 

we encamped at Sarlf. He (the Holy Prophet) went to his Companiens and said: He who has no sacri-

ficial animal with him, in his case I wish that he should perform Umra (with this Ihram), and he 

who has the sacrificial animal with him should not do it. So some of thtm performed Hajj whereas 

others who had no sacrificial animals with them did not do (Hajj, but per- formed only 'Umra). The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had the sacrificial animal with him and those too who 

could afford it (performed) Hajj). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to me (i. e. 

A'isha) while I was weeping, and he said: What makes thee weep? I said: I heard your talk with 

Companions about Umra. He said: What has happened to you? I said: I do not observe prayer (due to 

the monthly period), whereupon besaid: It would not harm you; you should perform (during this 

time) the rituals of Hajj (which you can do outside the House). Maybe Allah will compensate you for 

this. You are one among the daughters of Adam and Allah has ordained for you as He has ordained 

for them. So I proceeded on (with the rituals of Hajj) till we came to Mina. I washed myself and then 

circumambuleted the House, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) encamped at 

Muhassab and called, Abd al-Rahman b. Abua Bakr. and said: Take out your sister from the precincts 

of the Ka'ba in order to put on Ihram for Umra and circumambulate the House. and I shall wait for 

you here. She said: So I went out and put on Ihram and then circu- mambulated the House. and (ran)

ace be upon him) commanded that he who did not have the sacrificial animal with him should put 

off Ibrim after circumambulating the House and running between al-Safa and aI-Marwa (and thus 

convert his Ihram from that of Hajj to 'Umra). 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The flesh of 

cow was sent to us on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'I-Hijja). I said. What is this? It was said: The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sacrificed (the cow) on behalf of his wives. Yabyi said: I

over, you should go to Tan'im and put on lhram and then meet us at such and such time (and I think 

he said tomorrow) ; and (the reward of this Umra) is for you equal to your hardship or your spen-

A'isha said: I entered in the monthly period and could not (therefore) circumambulate the House. 

When it was the night of Hasba she said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming. back (after having

to wait for me for the farewell circuit). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May you be wounded

are going for Hajj now (but I can't go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordaiucd

said: What kind of putting off? He said: Getting out of lhram completely. So we came to our wives, 

and put on our clothes and applied perfume. When it was the day of Tarwiya, we put on Ihram for 

Hajj. and the first circumambulation and (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa sufficed us.. Al-

Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later 

on. I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. SO they (the Companions) put. olf Ihrim 

and we also put off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: 'All 

came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) 

have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, 

Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Apostle of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) had entered. (The Holy Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i. e. Ihram cover-

ing both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And 'All brought a sacrificial animal for him (for 

the Holy Prophet). Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'shum said: Messenger of Allah, is it (this concession putting

to put off Ihrim and make it for 'Umra. We felt It (the command) hard for us, and our hearts were 

anguished on account of this and it (this reaction of the people) reached the Apostle of Allah (may 

peace be upon him). We do not know whether he received (this news) from the Heaven (through re-

velation) or from the people. (Whatever the case might be) he said; O people, put off Ihram. If there 

were not the sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as you do. So we put off the Ihram (after 

performing   Umra),   and   we   bad   intercourse   with   our   wives   and   did   everything   which   a   non-

Muhrim does (applying perfume, putting on clothes, etc.), and when It was the day of Tarwiya (8th

Abu Nadra reported: Ibn'Abbas commanded the performance of Mut'a putting lhram for 'Umra 

during the months of Dhu'I-Hijja and after completing it. then putting on Ibrim for Hajj), but Ibn 

Zubair forbade to do it. I made a mention of it to Jabir b. Abdullih and he said: It is through me that 

this hadith has been circulated. We entered into the state of Ihram as Tamattu' with the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him). When 'Umar was Installed as Caliph, he said: Verily Allah made 

permissible for His Messenger (may peace be upon him) whatever He liked and as Re liked. And 

(every command) of the Holy Qur'an has been revealed for every occasion. So accomplish Hajj and 

Umra for Allah as Allah has commanded you; and confirm by (proper conditions) the marriage of 

those women (with whom you have performed Mut'a). And any person would come to me with a 

marriage of appointed duration (Mut'a), I would stone him (to death). Qatada narrated this hadith 

with the same chain of transmitters saying: (That 'Umar also said): Separate your Hajj from 'Umra, 

for that is the most complete Hajj, and complete your Umra.

Book 007, Number 2802: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We came with the Messenger of Allah 

(May peace be upon him) pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (May peace be 

upon him) commanded us to make (our Ihram) into that of Umra.

Farewell pilgrimage of the apostle of Allah (may peace 

be upon him)

Just as the first revelation in the cave of Hira' marks the advent of the apostolic mission of Mu-

hammad (May peace be upon him), similarly his Farewell Pilgrimage marks its crowning glory. Opi-

nions differ as to when Hajj became obligatory but the commonly accepted opinion is that it was in 

the eighth year of Hijra that Allah declared it as one of the five fundamentals of Islam. In the ninth 

year of Hijra the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) sent Abu Bakr as the leader of the Hajj dele-

gation but he himself did not go. Hadrat Abu Bakr was later on joined by Hadrat Ali in order to make 

a sure declaration on behalf of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) which concerned the 

freedom from obligation in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the trea-

ties which they had entered into with the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him). This declaration is 

contains in the opening verses of Sura Tauba.

The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) spent this year in making preparations for the Hajj in 

the tenth year of Hijra which coincided with the sixty-third year (the last year) of his life. Every att-

empt was, therefore, made to take full advantage of this great assembly. Messengers were sent to all 

parts of Arabia inviting people to join him in this great Pilgrimage. It was necessary for them since 

they should learn by first-hand knowledge the several injunctions and practices of the Pilgrimage-

free from all taints of ignorance-an ideal pattern which was to be kept intact in its pristine glory for 

all times to come. Not only the rites and rituals of the Pilgrimage were to be finally explained by the 

Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) but all those things which had any concern with Islam had 

been finalized.

The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) delivered a khutba on the 24th of Dhi-Qa'da on the 

occasion of the Friday prayer and gave the Muslims necessary instructions relating to Hajj. Next day, 

I. e. on the 25th of Dhi-Qa'da, he set out after Zuhr prayer on a journey for Hajj along with thou-

sands of his devoted Companions. The 'Asr prayer was offered at Dhu'l-Hulaifa. The caravan spent 

the night there and it was there after the Zuhr prayer that the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon 

him) and his Companions put on Ihram and proceeded towards Mecca. They reached their destinati-

on on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja pronouncing Talbiya (Labbaik, Labbaik, Allahumma Labbaik).

As the caravan moved on the number of participants swelled till, according to some of the narra-

tors, it reached more than one lakh and thirty thousands. The Farewell Pilgrimage is one of the most 

important occasions in the sacred life of Muhammad (May peace be upon him). Apart from the rites 

and rituals, the addresses and speeches of the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) succinctly sum 

up the teachings of Islam.

Book 007, Number 2803: 

Ja'far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We went to Jabir b. Abdullah and he 

began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I am Mu-

hammad b. 'Ali b. Husain. He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then 

the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those 

days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I 

asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer 

came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoul-

ders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on 

the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's 

Messenger (May peace be upon him). And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, 

then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all 

of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according 

to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu'l-Hulaifa. Asma' daughter of Umais gave birth 

to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) 

asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts 

and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and 

then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida'. And I 

saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my 

left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was prominent 

among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows 

(its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah 

(saying):" Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the 

Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner."

And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Al-

lah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May pe-

ace. be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not 

have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when 

we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of 

them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:" And adopt the Station 

of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And this Station was between him and the House. My father said 

(and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle [May pe-

ace be upon him] that he recited in two rak'ahs:" say: He is Allah One," and say:" Say: 0 unbelievers." 

He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa' 

and as he reached near it he recited:" Al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Al-

lah," (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa' till 

701 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 07: THE BOOK OF PILGRIMAGE (KITAB AL-HAJJ)

he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:" 

There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is 

due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, 

helped His servant and routed the confederates alone." He then made supplication in the course of 

that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his 

feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he 

reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa'. And when it was his last running at al-

Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have 

brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an 'Umra. So, he who among you has not the 

sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'sham 

got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? The-

reupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into 

another and said twice: The 'Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):" No, but for ever 

and ever." 'All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon 

him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram 

and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat'Ali) showed disapproval to it, 

whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that 'Ali used to 

say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fati-

mah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he 

said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked 'Ali): What did you 

say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I ('Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same pur-

pose as Thy Messenger has put it on.

He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total 

number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the 

Apostle (may peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (may pe-

ace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair 

clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram 

for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (may peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sun-

set 'Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of 

hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then set out and 

the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish 

used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, 

passed on till he came to 'Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There 

he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought 

and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Ve-

rily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in 

this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is 

under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance.

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 07: THE BOOK OF PILGRIMAGE (KITAB AL-HAJJ)

The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith, 

who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic pe-

riod is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all 

abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and 

intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over 

them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do 

that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them 

with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold 

fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), 

(now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have 

conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. 

He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing 

it at the people (said):" O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness," saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronoun-

ced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered 

Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in bet-

ween the two.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place 

of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the 

path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till 

the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He 

made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head tou-

ched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with 

his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of 

sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he rea-

ched al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and 

did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Ma-

ghrib and 'Isha' prayers). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn 

and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again 

mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated 

Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept 

standing till the daylight was very clear.

He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. 'Abbas and he was 

a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah 

(May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with 

them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his 

hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face 

of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He 

urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, 

703 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 07: THE BOOK OF PILGRIMAGE (KITAB AL-HAJJ)

he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-

Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with 

the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, 

and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to 'All 

who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh 

from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy 

Prophet and Hadrat 'All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (May 

peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He 

came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. 

O Bani 'Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, 

I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.

Book 007, Number 2804: 

Ja'far b. Muhammad narrated on the authority of his father thus: I came to Jabir b. Abdullah and 

asked him about the (Farewell) Pilgrimage of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). The rest of 

the hadith is the same, but with the addition of this:" There was one Abu Sayyara among the Arabs, 

(of pre-Islamic period) who carried (people from Muzdalifa to Mini). As the Messenger of Allah 

(May peace be upon him) set out from Muzdalifa to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, the Quraish were certain 

that he would halt there and that would be his station. But he passed on (without staying) there. and 

paid no heed to it till he came to 'Arafat and there he stayed."

Book 007, Number 2805: 

Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (May peace be upon him) as saying: I have sacrificed (the ani-

mals) here, and the whole of Mini is a place for sacrifice; so sacrifice your animals at your places. 1 

have stayed here (near these rocks), and the whole of Arafat is a place for stay. And I have stayed 

here (at Muzdalifa near Mash'ar al-Haram and the whole of Muzdalifa) is a place for stay (i. e. one is 

permitted to spend night in any part of it, as one likes).

Book 007, Number 2806: 

Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) proceeded to Mecca, he came to it (the Black Stone). he kissed it. and moved to his 

right. and moved quickly in three circuits, and walked in four circuits.

Book 007, Number 2807: 

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Quraish (of the pre-Islamic days) and those 

who followed their religions practices stayed at Muzdalifa, and they named themselves as Hums, 

whereas all other Arabs stayed at 'Arafa. With the advent of Islam, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, 

commanded His Apostle (may peace be upon him) to come to 'Arafat and stay there, and then hurry 

from there, and this is the significance of the words of Allah:" Then hasten on from where the people 

hasten on."

Book 007, Number 2808: 

Hisham narrated on the authority of his father that the Arabs with the exception of Hums who 

were Quraish, and their descendants, circumambulated the House naked. They kept circumambula-

ting In this state of nudity unless the Hums supplied to them the clothes. The male provided (clothes) 

to the male and the female provided clothes to the female. And the Hums did not get out of Muzdali-

fa, whereas the people (other than the Quraish) went t o 'Arafat. Hisham said on the authority of his 

father who related from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) who said: Hums are those about whom 

Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" Then hasten to where the people hasten." She 

(further) said: The people hastened on from 'Arafat, whereas Hums hastened from Muzdalifa, and 

said: We'do not hasten but from Haram. But when this (verse) was revealed:" Hasten on from that 

(place) where the people hasten on," they (the Quraish) then went to 'Arafat.

Book 007, Number 2809: 

Jubair. b. Mut'im reported: I lost my camel and went in search of it on the day of 'Arafa, and I saw 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) staying along with people in 'Ara'fit. Thereupon I 

said: By Allah, he is among the Hums (Quraish) ; what has happened to him that he has come to this 

(place)? The Quraish were counted among Hums.

again said: With what intention have you entered into the state of Ihram (for Ifrad, Qiran or Tamat-

tu'). I said: I pronounced Talbiya (I have entered into the state of Ihram ) with that very aim with 

which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) is pronouncing Talbiya. He (the Holy Prophet) 

said; You have done well. Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' 

and put off Ihram (as you have not brought the sacrificial animals along with you). So I circumam-

bulated the House, and ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' and then came to a woman of the tribe 

of Qais and she rid my head of the lice. I again put on Ihram for Hajj. and continued giving religious 

verdict (according to this practice) till during the Caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him) 

when a person said to him: Abu Musa, or Abdullah b. Qais, exercise restraint in delivering some reli-

gious verdict of yours, for you do not know what has been introduced after you by the Commander 

of the Believers in the rites (of Hajj). Thereupon he said: 0 people, whom we gave the religious ver-

dict (concerning putting off Ihram ) they should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to 

come to you, and you should follow him. Umar (Allah be pleased with him) then came and I made a 

mention of it to him. whereupon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) the Book of Allah 

has commanded us to complete the (. Hajj and 'Umra), and if we abide by the Sunnah of Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him), we find that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not

al-Safa' and al-Marwa and put off Ihram. So I circumambulated the House, ran between al-Safa' and 

al-Marwa, and then came to a woman of my tribe. She combed and washed my head. I used to give 

religious verdict (according to the above mentioned command of the Holy Prophet) during the Cali-

phate of Abu Bakr and also during that of 'Umar. And it was during the Hajj season that a person 

came to me and said: You (perhaps) do not know what the Commander of the Believers has introdu-

ced in the rites (of Hajj). I said: 0 people, those whom we have given religious verdict about a certain 

thing should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to arrive among you, so follow him. 

When the Commander of the Believers arrived, I said: What is this that you have introduced in the

serve fast for three days during the Hajj and for se-

ven days when he returns to the family 

Book 007, Number 2832: 

Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

then offered animal sacrifice. So he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Dhu'l-Hulaifa. Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya 

for 'Umra. and then (put on Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people perfor-

med Tamattu' in the company of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). They put on Ihram for 

Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had brought with 

them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals 

along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has 

completed the Hajj; and he, who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circu-

mambulate the House, and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ih-

ram, and then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not 

find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days 

when he returns to his family. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) circumambulated (the 

House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), 

then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits. And then when he had finished 

the circumambulation of the House he observed two rak'ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), 

and then pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak'ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa' and 

ran seven times between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which 

had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice 

(10th of Dhu'l-Hijja). and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of 

the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and tho-

se who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) had done. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha. The wife of Allah's

Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah's Apostle (may peace be

and al-marwa; and if it were so as you state, then (the wording would have been (fala janah an la 

yatufu biha) [" There is no harm for him if he does not circumambulate between them']. Do you 

know in what context (this verse was revealed)? (It was revealed in this context) that the Ansar in 

the Days of Ignorance pronounced the Talbiya for two idols. (fixedl on the bank of the river which 

were called Isaf and Na'ila. The people went there, and then circumambulated between al-Safa' and 

al-Marwa and then got their heads shaved. With the advent of Islam they (the Muslims) did not like 

to circumambulate between them as they used to do during the Days of Ignorance. It was on account 

of this that Allah. the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:" Verily al-Safe and al-Marwa are among the Si-

gns of Allah" to the end of the verse. She said: Then people began to observe Sa'i.

Book 007, Number 2924: 

Hisham b. 'Urwa narrated on the authority of his father who reported: I said to 'A'isha: I do not see 

any harm to me if I do not circumambulate betweez al-Safa' and al-Marwa. She said: On what 

ground do you say so? (I said: ) Since Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, says:" Verily al-Safa' and al-

Marwa are among the Signs of Allah." It (your assertion) were (correct), it would have been said like 

this:" There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate between them." It (this verse) has 

been revealed about the people of Ansar. Whenever they pronounced the Talbiya, they pronounced it 

in the name of al-Manat during the Days of Ignorance; so they (thought) that it was not permissible 

for them (for the Muslims) to circumambulate between and al-Marwa. When they (the Muslims) 

came with Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) for Hajj, they mentioned it to him. So Allah, the 

Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse. By my life, Allah will not complete the Hajj of one who has 

not circumambulated between al-Safa and al-Marwa.

Book 007, Number 2925: 

'Urwa b. Zabair reported: I said to 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him): I do 

not see any (fault) in one who does not circumambl" te between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and I do not 

mind if I do not circumambulate between them, whereupon she said: O, the son of my sister, what 

you say is wrong. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) observed Sa'i and so did the Muslims. 

So it is a Sunnah (of the Prophet). And it was a common practice (with the pagan Arabs) that those 

who pronounced Talbiya for the wretched al-Manat, situated at Mushalla, did not observe Sa'i bet-

ween al-Safa' and al-Marwa. With the advent of Islam, we asked Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon 

him) about this practice, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed 

this verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" ; so he who performed Hajj or 

'Umra it is no sin on him if he circumambulates them. And if it were as you state, (then the wording 

would have been):" There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate round them." 

Zuhri said: I made a mention of that to Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al- Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham; he was 

impressed by that and said: This is what is called knowledge. And I have heard many a scholar say-

ing: Many of the Arabs who did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa caid: Our cir-

cumambulation between these two hills is an act of ignorance; whereas others among the Ansar said: 

We have been commanded to circumambulate the House, and not Commanded to run between al-

Safa' and al-Marwa. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed thia verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-

Marwa are among the Signs of Allah." Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al-Rahman said: I think that this (verse) has

phet) asked Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) about this, they said: Messenger of Allah, we 

felt reluctant to circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. Then Allah, the Exalted and Maje-

stic, revealed this verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of. Allah so he who per-

form Hajj or Umra it is no sin on him if he should circumambulate between them. 'A'isha (Allah be

as Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet). So it is not advisable for anyone to abandon this Sa'i between them.

Book 007, Number 2927: 

'Urwa b. Zabair narrated on the authority of 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) who informed him 

that the Ansar and the people of the tribe of Ghassan before embracing Islam pronounced Talbiya 

for Manat, and so they avoided circumambulating between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and it was a 

common practice with their forefather, that he who put on Ihram for Manat did not circumambulate 

between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. And when they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) about it, and then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:" Verily al-

Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" ; so he who performs Hajj or Umra, for him there 

is no harm if he should circumambulate between them, and he who does good spontaneously-surely 

Allah is Bountiful in rewarding and Knowing.

'Ata' reported: The House was burnt during the time of Yazid b. Muawiya when the people of Syria 

had fought (in Mecca). And it happened with it (the Ka'ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn Zubair (Al-

lah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The 

idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. 

When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka'ba. Should I demo-

lish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of 

it? Ibn 'Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only re-

pair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people 

embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and 

over which Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair said: It the 

house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what

BOOK 07: THE BOOK OF PILGRIMAGE (KITAB AL-HAJJ)

about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good ad-

vice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good 

advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall 

from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of de-

molishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. 

When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed 

to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facili-

ties to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zu-

bair said: I heard 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) 

had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to re-

construct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. 

And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today 

have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest 

against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared 

(the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka'ba). and the people saw that and 

it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka'ba was eighteen cubits. 

when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) 

small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length 

(also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one 

for exit. When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to 'Abd al-Malik (b. 

Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had 

built (the Ka'ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons 

among the Meccans had seen. 'Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring 

of Ibn Zubair in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever 

he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he 

had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it 

on (its previous) foundations.

Abdullah b. 'Ubaid reported that Harith b. 'Abdullah led a deputation to 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan

from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) (about the intended wish of the Holy Prophet [may peace be

('Abd al-Malik) said: Well, tell me what you heard from her. He stated that she (Hadrat 'A'isha) had 

said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) remarked: Verily your people have reduced 

(the area) of the House from its (original foundations, and if they had not recently abandoned poly-

theism (and embraced Islam) I would have reversed it to (those foundations) which they had left out 

of it. nd if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so 

that I should show you what they have left out of it. He showed her about fifteen cubits of area from

Walid b. 'Ata' has, however, made this addition to it:" Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I 

would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know 

why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka'ba)? She said: No. He said: (They 

did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they 

wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to 

enter, they pushed him and he fell down." 'Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her 

saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he ('Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff 

for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair's) work there.

the Ka'ba). He said, Yes. I said: Then why did they not include it in the House? He said: 'Your people 

ran short of the means (to do so). I said: Why is it that the level of its door is raised high? He said: 

Your people did it so that they should admit one whom they liked, and forbid him whom they disli-

ked, and if your people were not new converts to faith, and I did not apprehend that their hearts 

would feel agitated at this. I would have definitely included (the area of) this wall-in the House and 

would have brought the door to the level of the ground.

and its suburbs, and felling down of its trees and 

cutting its grass 

Book 007, Number 3139: 

Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as 

saying on the Day of Victory over Mecca: There is no Hijra (emigration) but only Jihad and good in-

tention; and when you are called to battle, then go forth. He also said on the Day of Victory over 

Mecca: Allah made this town sacred on the day He created the earth and the heavens; so it is -sacred 

by the sacred- ness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection and fighting in it was not 

lawful to anyone before me, and it was made lawful for me only during an hour on one day, for it is 

sacred by the sacredness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns are not to 

be cut, its game is not to be molested, and the things dropped are to be picked up only by one who 

makes a public announcement of it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut. Abbas (Allah be pleased 

with him) said: Messenger of Allah, exception may be made in case of rush, for it is useful for their 

blacksmiths and for their houses. He (the Holy Prophet) conceding the suggestion of 'Abbas) said: Ex-

cept rush.

Book 007, Number 3140: 

A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Mansur, but he did not mention:" On that 

very day He created the heavens and the earth," and he (the narrator) substituted the word" fighting" 

(qital) for" killing" (qatl), and further said:" No one is to pick up the dropped thing except one who 

makes a public announcement of it."

Book 007, Number 3141: 

Abu Shuraih al-'Adawi reported that he said to Amr b. Sa'id when he was sending troops to Mecca: 

Let me tell you something. O Commander, which Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said 

on the day following, the Conquest which my ears heard and my heart has retained, and my eyes 

saw as he spoke it. He praised Allah and extolled Him and then said: Allah, not men, has made Mecca 

sacred; so it is not permissible for any person believing in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it, 

or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks a concession on the basis of fighting of Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him), tell him that Allah permitted His Messenger, but not you, and He gave him per-

mission only for an hour on one day, and its sacredness was restored on the very day like that of yes-

terday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent. It was said to Abu Shu-

raih: What did Amr say to you? He said: I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih, but the 

sacred territory does not grant protection to one who is disobedient, or one who runs away after 

shedding blood, or one who runs away after committing

Book 007, Number 3142: 

Abu Huraira, (Allah be pleased with him) reported. When Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, granted 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) victory over Mecca, he stood before people and praised 

and extolled Allah and then said: Verily Allah held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the do-

mination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before 

me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after 

me. So neither molest the game, nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick 

up a thing dropped but one who makes public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is kil-

led he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take 

life as (a just retribution). 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah's Messenger, but Idhkhir (a 

kind of herbage), for we use it for our graves and for our houses, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) said: With the exception of Idhkhir. A person known as Abu Shah, one of the 

people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me. Thereupon Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said I Write it for Abu Shah. Walid said: I asked al-Auzai': What 

did his saying mean:" Write it for me, Messenger of Allah"? He said: This very address that he had 

heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).

Book 007, Number 3143: 

Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: The people of the Khuza'ah tribe killed a man 

of the tribe of Laith in the Year of Victory as a retaliation for one whom they had killed (whom the 

people of the tribe of Laith had killed). It was reported to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him). He mounted his camel and delivered this address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held 

back the Ele- phants from Mecca, and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it 

was not violable for anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was 

made violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made inviolable 

(for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not to be lopped, and (no one 

is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who makes an announcement of it. And one 

whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between two alternatives: either he should receive blood-mo-

ney or get the life of the (murderer) in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who 

was called Abu Shah, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he 

(Allah's Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the Quraish 

also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves. Thereupon Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) said: Except Idhkhir.

ce himself) ; thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Medina is like a furnace 

which drives away its impurity and purifies what is good.

BOOK 08: THE BOOK OF MARRIAGE (KITAB AL-NIKAH)

Introduction 

Marriage is a social institution as old as the human race itself. It may be defined as relations bet-

ween a man and a woman which is recognized by custom or law and involves certain rights and du-

ties, both in the case of the parties entering the Union, and in case of the children born of it. Marria-

ge has thus two main functions to perform: it is the means adopted by human society for regulating 

relations between the sexes; and it furnishes the mechanism by means of which the relations of a 

child to the community is determined. 

The rites and ceremonies of marriage have been different with different peoples and in different 

ages but these two functions mentioned above are common throughout. It always implies the right of 

sexual intercourse as allowed and recognized by society and the duties of the parents in bringing up 

children. 

Islam recognizes this institution and accepts it as the basis of human society after purging it of all 

those evils which had penetrated it. 

Firstly, Islam does not regard it as a union only for the gratification of sexual lust, but a social con-

tract with wide and varied responsibilities and duties. The reason behind it is that, according to the 

Divine Faith, a woman is not a plaything in the hand of man but a spiritual and moral being who is 

entrusted to him on the sacred pledge to which Allah is made a witness. The wife is, therefore, not 

meant to provide sensuous pleasure only to the male, but to fully co-operate with him in making the 

life of the family and ultimately of the whole humanity significantly meaningful. 

The Holy Qur'an has in so many verses pointed out the different purposes of marriage. It states: 

"And of His signs is that He has created wives for you from yourselves that you might find quiet of 

wind in them, and He put between you love and affection" (xxx. 21). In this verse it has been said 

that the female is not inferior to the male in the sense that the former is created out of a superior 

stuff while the latter comes of a base origin. Both man and woman are the progeny of Adam and thus 

both have the same soul. The purpose of marriage, according to the Holy Qur'an, is therefore, the 

union of the two souls which are one in essence. Their separate existence is an unnatural state of 

their being which changes into the natural state when they are united by marriage and thus are 

brought close to each other physically, mentally and emotionally 

Both man and woman are the joint heirs of the grace of life, and unless there is a very close and 

intimate form of companionship in them, they cannot enjoy the true grace of life. "He it is Who crea-

ted you from a single soul, and of the same did He make his spouse, that he might find comfort in 

her" (vii. 189). "Comfort" implies much more than a mere sexual gratification. It is not too much to 

say that the whole conception of the marriage relation in Islam is charged with spiritual and moral 

ideas, and must of necessity elevate the status of matrimonial alliance in the individual and social 

life. 

802 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 08: THE BOOK OF MARRIAGE (KITAB AL-NIKAH)

In Islam the union of the sexes has been purified and the joy of the married relation secured by 

the absolute prohibition of every kind of extra-matrimonial connection. The Holy Qur'an stresses 

upon the people to marry as it is the most effective means whereby one can lead a virtuous life free 

from immorality and emotional inhibition. The Holy Qur'an says: "They (your wives) are as a gar-

ment to you, and you are as a garment to them" (ii. 187). The mutual relation of husband and wife is 

here described in words which could not be surpassed in beauty. Herein is the correct description of 

the relationship between the two. The husband and the wife are for mutual support, mutual comfort 

and mutual protection, fitting into each other as garments fit into each other. 

Then the Holy Qur'an also makes it clear that this union is not a temporary relationship between 

two individuals of opposite sexes: It is a permanent and enduring relationship in the sense that both 

the parties should put in their earnest endeavors to lead their lives in perfect harmony and acquit-

ting themselves creditably of the responsibilities saddled upon them by entering into this sacred con-

tract. 

The Holy Qur'an further points out that sexual gratification in the married life is not meant only 

for the satisfaction of the physical lust, but it must be directed to some higher ends. "Your women are 

tilth for you, so go into your tilth as ye like, and provide beforehand for your souls, and fear Allah 

and know that you are going to meet Him" (iii. 223). Here the wives are likened to the cultivable land 

which are ploughed for sowing and reaping the produce (in the form of offspring) and not merely 

for carnal indulgence. The concluding part of the verse refers to still higher and sublime ends which 

tell that even in the height of carnal pleasures the moral and spiritual responsibilities should not in 

any way be lost sight of; rather one should be more conscious to them when one is enjoying physical 

pleasures as these are the moments when the fear of the Lord and the accountability in the Hereafter 

is likely to be blurred or effaced from one's mind. 

Chapter 1: One who can support a wife should marry 

Book 008, Number 3231:

He stopped there and began to talk with him. Uthman said to him: Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, should we 

not marry you to a young girl who may recall to you some of the past of your bygone days; thereu-

pon he said: If you say so, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: 0 young men, those 

among you who can support a wife should marry, for it restrains eyes from casting (evil glances). 

and preserves one from immorality; but those who cannot should devote themselves to fasting for it 

is a means of controlling sexual desire.

among the wives of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was dearer to him than I, and' A'isha 

liked that the women (of her family) should enter the houses as brides during the month of Shawwal.

ry a woman of the Ansar. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Did you cast 

a glance at her? He said: No. He said: Go and cast a glance at her, for there is something in the eyes of 

the Ansar.

of the Ansar? He said: I did cast a glance at her, whereupon he said: For what (dower) did you marry 

her? He said: For four 'uqiyas. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: For four 

'uqiyas; it seems as if you dig out silver from the side of this mountain (and that is why you are pre-

pared to pay such a large amount of dower). We have nothing which we should give you. There is a 

possibility that we may send you to an (expedition) where you may get (booty). So he sent that man

Chapter 13: The dower 

Book 008, Number 3316: 

Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi (Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman came to Allah's Messenger. 

(may peace be upon him) and said: Messerbger of Allah, I have come to you to entrust myself to you 

(you may contract my marriage with anyone at your discretion). Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) saw her and cast a glance at her from head to foot. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) then lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had made no decision in regard to her, 

she sat down. There stood up a person from amongst his companions and said: Messenger of Allah, 

marry her to me if you have no need of her. He (the Holy Prophet) said: is there anything with you 

(which you con give as a dower)? He said: No, Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have nothing. Thereu-

pon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Go to your people (family) and see if you can 

find something. He returned and said: I have found nothing. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: See even if it is an Iron ring. He went and returned and said: No, by God, not even an 

iron ring, but only this lower garment of mine (Sahl said that he had no upper garment), half of 

which (I am prepared to part with) for her. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: How can your lower garment serve your purpose, for it you wear it, she would not be able to 

make any use of it and if she wears it there would not be anything on you? The man sat down and as 

the sitting prolonged he stood up (in disappointment) and as he was going back Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) commanded (him) to be called back, and as he came, he said to him: Do 

you know any part of the Qur'an? He said: I know such and such surahs (and he counted them). 

whereupon he said: Can you recite them from heart (from your memory)? He said: Yes, whereupon 

he (Allah's Messenger) said: Go, I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur'an which 

you know.

Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out 

on an expedition to Khaibar and we observed our morning prayer in early hours of the dawn. The 

Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted and so did Abu Talha ride, and I was sea-

ting myself behind Abu Talha. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) moved in the narrow street 

of Khaibar (and we rode so close to each other in the street) that my knee touched the leg of Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him). (A part of the) lower garment of Allah's Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) slipped from his leg and I could see the whiteness of the leg of Allah's Apostle (may peace 

be upon him). As he entered the habitation he called: Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest). Khaibar 

is ruined. And when we get down in the valley of a people evil is the morning of the warned ones. He 

repeated it thrice. In the meanwhile the people went out for their work, and said: By Allah, Mu-

hammad (has come). Abd al-'Aziz or some of our com- panions said: Muhammad and the army 

(have come). He said: We took it (the territory of Khaibar) by force, and there were gathered the pri-

soners of war. There came Dihya and he said: Messenger of Allah, bestow upon me a girl ont of the 

prisones. He said: Go and get any girl. He made a choice for Safiyya daughter of Huyayy (b. Akhtab). 

There came a person to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of Allah, you have 

bestowed Safiyya bint Huyayy, the chief of Quraiza and al-Nadir, upon Dihya and she is worthy of

cloth was spread. A person came with cheese, another came with dates, and still another came with 

refined butter, and they prepared hais and that was the wedding feast of Allah's Messenger (may pe-

Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting behind Abu Talha on the Day of Khaibar 

and my feet touched the foot of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and we came (to the 

people of Khaibar) when the sun had risen and they had driven out their cattle, and had themselves 

come out with their axes, large baskets and hatchets, and they said: (Here come) Muhammad and the 

army. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down 

in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur'an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the 

Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of 

Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) got her in exchange of seven 

heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for 

marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that 

so that she might spend her period of 'Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim's) house. (The woman) was Safiyya 

daughter of Huyayy. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) arranged the wedding feast consis-

ting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths, 

and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there. And the people ate to 

their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free 

woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then 

she would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should 

be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part 

of the camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina, Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did. 'Adba' (the name of Al-

(Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her. woman looked to-

wards her and said: May Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba Hamza, did 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) really fall down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell 

down. Anas said: I also saw the wedding feast of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet) served bread and 

meat to the people, and made them eat to their heart's content, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to 

call people, and as he was free (from the ceremony) he stood up and I followed him. Two persons 

were left and they were busy in talking and did not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) 

then proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with as-Salamu 'alaikum to every 

one of them and said: Members of the household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we 

are in good state 'How do you find your family? He would say: In good state. When he was free from 

(this work of exchanging greetings) he came back, and I also came back along with him. And as he 

reached the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking. And when they saw him ha-

ving returned, they stood up and went out; and by Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, 

or there was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone. He (the Holy Prophet) then came 

back and I also returned along with him, and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung 

a curtain between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: (" O you 

who believe), do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to 'you" (xxxiii. 53).

Book 008, Number 3329: 

Anas, (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Safiyya (Allah be pleased with her) fell to the lot of 

Dihya in the spoils of war, and they praised her in the presence of Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and said: We have not seen the like of her among the captives of war. He sent (a messen-

ger) to Dihya and he gave him whatever he demanded. He then sent her to my mother and asked her 

to embellish her. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) then got out of Khaibar until when he 

was on the other side of it, he halted, and a tent was pitched for him. When it was morning Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who has surplus of provision with him should bring 

that to us. Some persons would bring the surplus of dates, and the other surplus of mush of barley 

until there became a heap of bals. They began to eat the hais and began to drink out of the pond 

which had the water of rainfall in it and which was situated by their side. Anas said that that consti-

tuted the wedding feast of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He (further) said: We pro-

ceeded until we saw the walls of Medina, and we were delighted. We made our mounts run quickly 

and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made his mount run quickly. And Safiyya (Al-

lah be pleased with her) was at his back, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had seated 

her behind him. The camel of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stumbled and he (the Holy 

Prophet) fell down and she also fell down. And none among the people was seeing him and her, until 

Allah's Messeuger (may peace be upon him) stood up and he covered her, and we came to him and

Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the 'Iddah of Zainab was over, Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him. Zaid went on until he 

came to her and she was fermenting her flour. He (Zaid) said: As I saw her I felt in my heart an idea 

of her greatness so much so that I could not see towards her (simply for the fact) that Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) had made a mention of her. So I turned my back towards her. and I 

turned upon my heels, and said: Zainab, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent (me) 

with a message to you. She said: I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood 

at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to her without permission. He (the narrator) said: I 

saw that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) served us bread and meat until it was broad 

day light and the people went away, but some persons who were busy in con- versation stayed on in 

the house after the meal. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) also went out and I also follo-

wed him, and he began to visit the apartments of his wives greeting them (with the words): As-Sala-

mu 'alaikum, and they would say: Allah's Messenger, how did you find your family (hadrat Zainab)? 

He (the narrator) stated: I do not know whether I had informed him that the people had gone out or 

he (the Holy Prophet) informed me (about that). He moved on until he entered the apartment, and I 

also went and wanted to enter (the apartment) along with him, but he threw a curtain between me 

and him, as (the verfes pertaining to seclusion) had been revealed, and people were instructed in 

what they had been instructed. Ibn Rafii had made this addition in his narration:" O you who believe,

it, he stood up and when he did so, some other persons stood up. 'Asim and Abd al-A'la in their nar-

came there to enter (the apartment) but he found the people sitting there. Then they stood up and 

went away. He said: Then I came and informed Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) that they 

had gone away. He (the Holy Prophet) then came there until he entered (the apartment). I also went 

and was about to enter, when he hung a curtain between me and him (and it was on this occasion

up (for departure) ; then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and walked on and I

he returned and I also returned with him, but they were still sitting at their places. So he returned for

I also returned and they had (by that time) stood up, and he hung a curtain between me and him (at

an earthen vessel and said: Anas, take it to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and say: My 

mother has sent that to you and she offers greetings to you, and says that it is a humble gift for you

half. He said: Place it here, and then said: Go and invite on my behalf so and so and anyone whom

whom I met. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Anas: How many (persons) were there? He (Anas) 

said: They were about three hundred persons. Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

(said to me): Anas, bring that earthen vessel. They (the guests) then began to enter until the courtyard 

and the apartment were fully packed. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Make a 

circle of ten (guests), and every person should eat from that nearest to him. They began to eat, until 

they ate to their fill. A group went out (after eating the food), and another group came in until all of 

them had eaten. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Anas, lift it (the earthen vessel), so I lifted it, but I 

could not assess whether it had more (food) when I placed it (before Allah's Messenger) or when I 

lifted it (after the people had been served out of it). A group among them (the guests) began to talk in 

the house of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

troublesome for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so Allah's Messenger (may peace be

Messenger (may peace be upon him) had returned they thought that it (their overstay) was some-

thing troublesome for him. He (the narrator) said: They hastened towards the door and all of them 

went out. And there came Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he hung a curtain and 

went in, and I was sitting in his apartment and he did not stay but for a short while. He then came to

them to the people:" O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is gi-

when   you   have   taken   food,   disperse   not   seeking   to   listen   to   talk.   Surely   this   gives   the   Prophet

with you, or you could amuse with her and she could amuse with you? I said to him: 'Abdullah died 

(he fell as martyr in Uhud) and left nine or seven daughters behind him; I, therefore, did not approve 

of the idea that I should bring a (girl) like them, but I preferred to bring a woman who should look 

after them and teach them good manners, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) said: May Allah bless 

you, or he supplicated (for the) good (to be) conferred on me (by Allah).

Book 008, Number 3461: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were with Allah's Messenger (may

slow. There met me a rider from behind me and he goaded it with an iron-tipped stick which he had 

with him. My camel moved forward like the best that you have ever seen. As I turned (my face) I 

found him to be Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) He said: Jabir, what hastens you? I said: 

Messenger of Allah, I am newly wedded. whereupon he said: Is it a virgin that you have married or 

one previously married? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why not a young girl so that 

you could play with her and she could play with you? Then when we arrived at and were about to 

enter Medina he said: Wait, so that we may enter by night (i. e. in the evening) in order that the wo-

man with dishevelled hair may comb it, and the woman whose husband had been away may get 

herself clean; and when you enter (then you have the) enjoyment (of tho wife's company).

Book 008, Number 3463: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I went out with Allah's Messenger (may

and call) He said: What is the matter with you? I said: My camel has delayed me and is tired, so I 

have lagged behind. He (the Holy Prophet) got down and goaded it with a crooked stick and then 

said: Mount it. So I mounted and (to my great surprise) I saw it (moving so quickly that) I had to res-

train it (from going ahead of) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) (in 

the course of journey said to me): Have you married? I said: Yes. He (again) said: Is it with a virgin or 

one previously married? I said. With one previously married, whereupon he (again) said: Why not 

with a young girl with whom you could sport and she could have sported with you? I said: I have 

sisters, so I preferred to marry a woman who could keep them together (as one family). who could

comb them and look after them. He said: You are about to go (to your house), and there you have the 

enjoyment (of the wife's company). He again said: Do you want to sell your camel? I said: Yes. So he 

bought it from me for one u'qiya (of silver), Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) arri-

ved (at Medina) and I arrived in the evening. I went to the mosque and found him at the door of the 

mosque, and said: Is it now that you have arrived? I said: Yes, He said: Leave your camel, and enter 

(the mosque) and offer two rak'ahs. So I entered and offered two rak'ahs of prayer, and then retur-

ned. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded Bilal to weigh out one 'uqiya (of silver) tor me. Bilal 

weighed that out for me (lowering the scale of) balance. So I proceeded and as I turned my back he 

said: Call for me, Jabir. So I was called back, and I said (to myself): He would return me the camel, 

and nothing was more displeasing to me than this (that after having received the price I should also 

get the camel). He said: Take your camel and keep its price with you, (also).

Book 008, Number 3464: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were with Allah's Messenger (may

behind all persons. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) hit it or goaded it (I think) with so-

mething he had with him. And after it (it moved so quickly) that it went ahead of all persons and it 

struggled with me (to move faster than I permitted It) and I had to restrain it. Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. I said: 

Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He (again) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant 

you pardon. ' I said: Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He said to me: Have you married after the death of 

your father? I said: Yes. He (again) said: With one previously married or a virgin? I said: With one 

previously married. He said: Why didn't you marry a virgin who might amuse you and you might 

amuse her, and she might sport with you and you might sport with her? Abu Nadra said: That was 

the common phrase which the Muslims spoke:" You do such and such (thing) and Allah may grant 

you pardon."

BOOK 09: THE BOOK OF DIVORCE (KITAB AL-TALAQ)

Introduction 

The Arabic word for divorce is talaq which means" freeing or undoing the knot" (Imam Raghib). In 

the terminology of the jurists. Talaq signifies the dissolution of marriage, or the annulment of its le-

gality by the pronouncement of certain words. 

Divorce is of three kinds: the Ahsan, or most laudable, the Hasan, or laudable, and the Bid'a or ir-

regular. 

Talaq Ahsan or the most laudable divorce is where the husband repudiates his wife by making one 

pronouncement within the term of Tahr (purity. when the woman is not passing through the period 

of menses) during which he has not had sexual intercourse with her, and she is left to observe her 

'Idda. 

Talaq Hasan or laudable divorce is where a husband repudiates an enjoyed wife by three sen-

tences of divorce, in three Tuhrs 

Talaq Bid'a or irregular divorce is where a husband repudiates his wife by three divorces at once. 

According to the majority of the jurists, the Talaq holds good, but it is against the spirit of the Sha-

ri'ah, and, therefore, the man who follows this course in divorce is an offender in the eye of Islamic 

Law. 

The right of woman in demanding the dissolution of marriage is known as Khula' (meaning, liter-

ally, the putting off or taking off a thing). It is a kind of facility provided to the wife in securing Talaq 

from her husband by returning a part or full amount of the bridal gift. 

We have described before that, according to Islam, marriage is a civil contract; yet the rights and 

responsibilities consequent upon it are of such importance to the welfare of humanity that a high 

degree of sanctity is attached to it. But, in spite of the sacredness of the character of the marriage tie, 

Islam recognises the eternity of divorce in cases when marital relations are poisoned to a degree 

which makes a peaceful home life impossible. But Islam does not believe in unlimited opportunities 

for divorce on frivolous and flimsy grounds, because any undue increase in tht facilities for divorce 

would   destroy   the   stability   of   family   life.   Therefore,   while   allowing   divorce   even   on   genuine 

grounds, Islam has taken great care to introduce checks designed to limit the use of available facili-

ties. The French legists Planiol and Ripert have explicitly emphasised Islam's point of view in regard 

to divorce in these words:" Divorce is a mischief. However, it is a measure that cannot be avoided for 

the welfare of the community, because it is the only remedy for another harm which may be wore 

dangerous The prohibition of divorce, whatever harm it may imply, is like the prohibition of surgery, 

because the surgeon is compelled to amputate some of the limbs of the patient's body. However, there 

is no danger whatsoever, in legislating for divorce (in accordance with the practice established by Is-

lam) since it is not divorce that spoils married life and dissolves its sacred tie, but the misunderstan-

ding that arises between the married couple and hinders the strengthening of this (union by marria-

ge) and demolished it. Divorce alone puts an end to the hatred that may occur between the husband 

and his wife before it is aggravated and becomes an intolerable mischief to society" (quoted by Hasan 

Ibrihim Hasan, Islam, Religious, Political. Social and Economic Study, p. 274). 

Chapter 1: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during 

her menses 

Book 009, Number 3473: 

Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was men-

struating during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). 'Umar b. Khattib (Allah 

be pleased with him) asked Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) about it, whereupon Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Command him ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) to take her back (and 

keep her) and pronounce divorce when she is purified and she again enters the period of menstrua-

tion and she is again purified (after passing the period of menses), and then if he so desires he may 

keep her and if he desires divorce her (finally) before touching her (without having an intercourse 

with her), for that is the period of waiting ('ldda) which God, the Exalted and Glorious, has comman-

ded for the divorce of women.

Book 009, Number 3474: 

Abdullah (b. 'Umar) reported that he divorced a wife of his with the pronouncement of one divor-

ce during the period of menstruation. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded him 

to take her back and keep her until she was purified, and then she entered the period of menses in 

his (house) for the second time. And he should wait until she was purified of her menses. And then if 

he would decide to divorce her, he should do so when she was purified before having a sexual inter-

course with her; for that was the 'Idda which Allah had commanded for the divorce of women. Ibn 

Rumh in his narration made this addition: When 'Abdullah was asked about it, he said to one of 

them: If you have divorced your wife with one pronouncement or two (then you can take her back), 

for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded me to do it; but if you have divorced 

her with three pronouncements, then she is forbidden for you until she married another husband, 

and you disobeyed Allah in regard to the divorce of your wife what He had commanded you. (Mus-

lim said: The word" one divorce" used by Laith is good.)

Book 009, Number 3475: 

Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I divorced my wife during the lifetime of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) when she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased 

with him) made a mention of it to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said:

BOOK 09: THE BOOK OF DIVORCE (KITAB AL-TALAQ)

Command him to take her back and leave her (in that state) until she is purified. Then (let her) enter 

the period of second menses, and when she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before having a se-

xual intercourse with her, or retain her (finally). That is the 'Idda (the prescribed period) which Al-

lah commanded (to be kept in view) while divorcing the women. 'Ubaidullah reported: I said to Nafi': 

What became of that divorce (pronounced within 'Idda)? He said: It was as one which she counted.

Book 009, Number 3476: 

A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of 'Ubaidullah, but he made no mention of 

the words of Ubaidullah that he said to Nafi'.

Book 009, Number 3477: 

Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife during the period of 

menses. 'Umar (Allah be, pleas'ed with him) asked Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he 

commanded him ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) to have her back and then allow her respite until she enters 

the period of the second menses, and then allow her respite until she is purified, then divorce her (fi-

nally) before touching her (having a sexual intercourse with her), for that is the prescribed period 

which Allah commanded (to be kept in view) for divorcing the women. When Ibn 'Umar (Allah be 

pleased with them) was asked about the person who divorces his wife in the state of menses, he said: 

If you pronounced one divorce or two, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had commanded 

him to take her back, and then allow her respite until she enters the period of the second menses, 

and then allow her respite until she is purified, and then divorce her (finally) before touching her 

(having a sexual intercourse with her) ; and if you have pronounced (three divorces at one and the 

same time) you have in fact disobeyed your Lord with regard to what He commanded you about di-

vorcing your wife. But she is however (finally separated from you).

Book 009, Number 3478: 

Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I divorced my wife while she was in the 

state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) made mention of it to Allah's Apostle (may peace 

be upon him) and he was enraged and he said: Command him to take her back until she enters the 

second ensuing menses other than the one in which he divorced her and in case he deems proper to 

divorce her, he should pronounce divorce (finally) before touching her (in the period) when she is 

purified of her menses, and that is the prescribed period in regard to divorce as Allah has comman-

ded. 'Abdullah made a pronouncement of one divorce and it was counted in case of divorce. 'Abdul-

lah took her back as Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had commanded him. A hadith like 

this was reported on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of narrators. Ibn Umar (Allah be 

pleased with them), however, said: I took her back, and counted this pronouncement of divorce (as 

valid) with which I divorced her.

would visit you and draw close to you, say to him: Allah's Messenger, have you taken maghafir? And 

he would'say to you: No. Then say to him: What is this odour? And Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) felt it very much that unpleasant odour should emit from him. So he would say to you: 

Hafsa has given me a drink of honey. Then you should say to him: The honey-bees might have 

sucked 'Urfut, and I would also say the same to him and. Safiyya, you should also say this. So when 

he (the Holy Prophet) came to Sauda, she said: By Him besides whom there is no god, it was under 

compulsion that I had decided to state that which you told me when he would be at a little distance 

at the door. So when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came near, she said: Messenger of 

Allah, did you eat Maghafir? He said: No. She (again) said: Then what is this odour? He said: Hafsa 

gave me honey to drink. She said: The honey-bee might have sucked 'Urfut. When he came to me I 

told him like this. He then visited Safiyya and she also said to him like this. When he (again) visited 

Hafsa, she said: Messenger of Allah, should I not give you that (drink)? He said: I do not need that. 

Sauda said: Hallowed be Allah, by Him we have (contrived) to make that (honey) unlawful for him. I 

said to her: Keep quiet. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Urwa with the same chain 

of transmitters.

Chapter 4: Mere giving of option of divorce to women

Book 009, Number 3498: 

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) was commanded to give option to his wives, he started it from me saying: I am going to mention 

to you a matter which you should not (decide) in haste until you have consulted your parents. She 

said that he already knew that my parents would never allow me to seek separation from him She 

said: Then he said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: Prophet, say to thy wives: If you desire this 

world's life and its adornment, then come, I will give you a provision and allow you to depart a 

goodly departing; and if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then Al-

lah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward She is reported to have said: About

what should I consult my parents, for I desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereaf-

done.

Book 009, Number 3499: 

'A'isha (Allah be  pleased  with her) reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace  be upon  him) 

sought our permission when he had a (turn to spend) a day with (one of his wives) amongst us 

(whereas he wanted to visit his other wives too). It was after this that this verse was revealed:" Thou 

mayest  put  off  whom  thou  pleasest   of  them,  and  take  for   thee  whom  thou   pleasest"   (xxxiii.  5). 

Mu'adha said to her: What did you say to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) when he 

sought your permission? She said: I used to say: If it had the option in this I would not have (allowed 

anyone) to have precedence over me.

Book 009, Number 3500: 

'A'isha reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave us the option (to get divorce) 

but we did not deem it as divorce.

Masruq reported: I do not mind if I give option to my wife (to get divorce) once, hundred times, or 

thousand times after (knowing it) that she has chosen me (and would never seek divorce). I asked 

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) (about it) and she said: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) gave us the option, but did it imply divorce? (It was in fact not a divorce; it is effective when 

women actually avail themselves of it.)

Book 009, Number 3502: 

'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave option to his wives, but it 

was not a divorce.

Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) 

came and sought permission to see Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He found people sit-

ting at his door and none amongst them had been granted permission, but it was granted to Abu 

Bakr and he went in. Then came 'Umar and he sought permission and it was granted to him, and he 

found Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him. He 

(Hadrat 'Umar) said: I would say something which would make the Holy Prophet (may peace be 

upon him) laugh, so he said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you had seen (the treatment meted out to) 

the daughter ofKhadija when you asked me some money, and I got up and slapped her on her neck. 

Allah's Messenger (mav peace be upon him) laughed and said: They are around me as you see, as-

king for extra money. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) then got up went to 'A'isha (Allah be 

pleased with her) and slapped her on the neck, and 'Umar stood up before Hafsa and slapped her 

saying: You ask Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) which he does not possess. They said: By 

Allah, we do not ask Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) for anything he does not possess. 

Then he withdrew from them for a month or for twenty-nine days. Then this verse was revealed to 

him:" Prophet: Say to thy wives... for a mighty reward" (xxxiii. 28). He then went first to 'A'isha (Allah 

be pleased with her) and said: I want to propound something to you, 'A'isha, but wish no hasty reply 

before you consult your parents. She said: Messenger of Allah, what is that? He (the Holy Prophet) 

recited to her the verse, whereupon she said: Is it about you that I should consult my parents, Mes-

senger of Allah? Nay, I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Abode; but I ask you not to tell any 

of your wives what I have said He replied: Not one of them will ask me without my informing her. 

God did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He has sent me to teach and make things easy.

Chapter 5: Ila'and keeping away from the wives 

Book 009, Number 3507: 

'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Allah's Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) kept himself away from his wives, I entered the mosque, and found people striking the 

ground with pebblesand saying: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) has divorced his wives, 

and that was before they were commanded to observe seclusion 'Umar said to himself: I must find 

this (actual position) today. So I went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said (to her): Daugh-

ter of Abu Bakr, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him)? Thereupon she said: Son of Khattab, you have nothing to do with me, and I have nothing 

to do with you. You should look to your own receptacle. He ('Umar) said: I visited Hafsa daughter of 

'Umar, and said to her: Hafsa, the (news) has reached me that you cause Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) trouble. You know that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) does not love 

you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you. (On hearing this) she wept bitter-

ly. I said to her: Where is Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)? She said: He is in the attic 

room. I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), sitting 

on the thresholds of the window dangling his feet on the hollow wood of the date-palm with the 

help of which Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) climbed (to the apartment) and came 

down. I cried: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him). 

Rabah cast a glance at the apartment and then looked toward me but said nothing. I again said: Ra-

bah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). Rabah looked to-

wards the apartment and then cast a glance at me, but said nothig. I then raised my voice and said: 0 

Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I think that Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) is under the impression that I have come for the sake of Hafsa. 

By Allah, if Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) would command me to strike her neck, I 

would certainly strike her neck. I raised my voice and he pointed me to climb up (and get into his 

apartment). I visited Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he was lying on a mat. I sat 

down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he had nothing (else) over him, and that the 

mat had left its marks on his sides. I looked with my eyes in the store room of Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him). I found only a handful of barley equal to one sa' and an equal quantity of the 

leaves of Mimosa Flava placed in the nook of the cell, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging (in one 

side), and I was moved to tears (on seeing this extremely austere living of the Holy Piophet), and he 

said: Ibn Khattab, what wakes you weep?

I said: Apostle of Allah, why should I not shed tears? This mat has left its marks on your sides and I 

do not see in your store room (except these few things) that I have seen; Ceasar and Closroes are lea-

ding their lives in plenty whereas you are Allah's Messenger. His chosen one, and that is your store! 

He said: Ibn Khattab, aren't you satisfied that for us (there should be the prosperity) of the Hereafter, 

869 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 09: THE BOOK OF DIVORCE (KITAB AL-TALAQ)

and for them (there should be the prosperity of) this world? I said: Yes. And as I had entered I had 

seen the signs of anger on his face, and I therefore, said: Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel 

from your wives, and if youhave divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Gabriel, Mika'il, 

I and Abu Bakr and the believers are with you. And seldom I talked and (which I uttered on that day) 

I hoped that Allah would testify to my words that I uttered. And so the verse of option (Ayat al-Tak-

hyir) was revealed. Maybe his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than 

you..." (Ixv. 5). And if you back up one another against him, then surely Allah is his Patron, and Ga-

briel and the righteous believers, and the angels after that are the aidera (lvi. 4). And it was 'A'isha, 

daughter of Abu Bakr, and Hafsa who had prevailed upon all the wives of Allah's Prophet (way peace 

be upon him) for (pressing them for mote money). I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced 

them? He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah, I entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing 

with pebbles (absorbed in thought) and saying: Allah's Messenger has divorced his wives. Should I 

get down and inform there that you have not divorced them? He said: Yes, if you so like. And I went 

on talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on his face and (his seriousness was 

changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof) his face had the natural tranquillity upon it and he 

laughed and his teeth were the most charming (among the teeth) of all people. Then Allah's Apostle 

(may peace be upon him) climbed down and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of 

the palm-tree and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came down (with such ease) as if he 

was walking on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get support). I said: Messenger 

of Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine days. He said: (At times) the month con-

sists of twenty-nine days. I stood at the door of the mosque and I called out at the top of my voice: 

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has not divorced his wives (and it was on this oc-

casion that this) verse was revealed:" And if any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes within 

their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Apostle and those who have been 

entrusted with authority amongst them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence 

would indeed know (what to do with) it" (iv 83). And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah 

revealed the verse pertaining to option (given to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him in regard 

to the retaining or divorcing of his wives).

Book 009, Number 3508: 

Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with tlicm) reported: I intended to ask 'Umar b. al-Khattab 

(Allah be pleased with him) about a verse, but I waited for one year to ask him out of his fear, until 

he went out for Pilgrimage and I also accompanied him. As he came back and we were on the way 

he stepped aside towards an Arak tree to ease himself. I waited for him until he was free. I then wal-

ked along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the wives of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who backed up one another (in their demand for extra 

money)? He said: They were Hafsa and 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with them). I said to him: It is for one 

year that I intended to ask you about this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for 

you. He said: Don't do that. If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that. And if I

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 09: THE BOOK OF DIVORCE (KITAB AL-TALAQ)

were to know that, I would inform you. He (the narrator) stated that 'Umar had said: By Allah, du-

ring the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalt- ed revealed about 

them what He has revealed, and appointed (turn) for them what he appointed. He said: It so happe-

ned that I was thinking about some matter that my wife said: I wish you had done that and that. I 

said to her: It does not concern you and you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to 

do. She said to me: How strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon 

you,  whereas  your   daughter   retorts  upon   Allah's  Messenger   (may   peace  be  upou   him)  until   he 

spends the day in vexation. 'Umar said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of my house until I vi-

sited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, (I heard) that you retort upon Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) until he spends the day in vexation, whereupon Hafsa said: By Allah, we do retort upon 

him. I said: You should bear in mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah 

and the wrath of His Messenger (may peace be upon him). You may not be misled by one whose be-

auty  has  fascinated  her, and the  love  of  Allah's  Messenger  (may   peace  be  upon  him)  for   her.  I 

('Umar) then visited Umm Salama because of my relationship with her and I talked to her. Umm Sa-

lama said to me: Umar b. al-Khattab, how strange is it that you meddle with every matter so much so 

that you are anxious to interfere between Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his wives, 

and this perturbed me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her 

apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar.

When I had been absent (from the company of the Holy Prophet) he used to bring me the news 

and when he had been absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of 

Ghassan. It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted by him. 

My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open it, open it. I said: Has 

the Ghassani come? He said: (The matter is) more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) has separated himself from his wives. I said: Let the nose of Hafsa and 'A'isha be 

besmeared with dust. I then took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of date-

palm, and the servant of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who was black had been sitting 

at the end of the ladder. I said: This is Umar. So permission was granted to me. I narrated this news to 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama, 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled. He was lying on the mat and there was nothing 

between him and that (mat), and under his head there was a pillow made of leather and it was stuf-

fed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree (acacia niloctica, meant for dyeing) 

and near his head there was hanging a hide. And I saw the marks of the maton the side of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him), and so I wept. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Messen-

ger of Allah, the Khusrau and the Ceasars (spendd their lives in) the midst of (luxuries), whereas you 

being Allah's Messenger (are leading your life in this poverty). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) said: Don't you like that they should have riches of their world, and you have the 

Hereafter.

answered the call of nature, as he came back, I began to pour water (over his hands and feet), and I

Umayya b. Zaid. One day I became angry with my wife and she retorted upon me. I did not like that 

she should retort upon me. She said: You disapprove of my retorting upon you By Allah, the wives of 

Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) retort upon him, and one of them detaches herself from 

him for the day until the night. So I ('Umar) went out and visited Hafsa and said: Do you retort upon 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)? She said: Yes. I said; Does any one of you detach herself 

from him from the day to the night? She said: Yes. He said: She who did like it amongst you in fact 

failed and incurred loss. Does everyone amongst you not fear the wrath of Allah upon her due to the 

wrath of His Messenger (may peace be upon him), and (as a result thereof) she may perish? So do 

not retort upon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and do not ask him for anything, but ask 

me that which you desire, (and the frank behaviour) of your companion may not mislead you, if she 

is more graceful and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) than you (meaning 

'A'isha) (Allah be pleased with her).

He (Hadrat 'Umar further) said: I had a compalaion from the Ansar and, we used to remain in the 

company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) turn by turn. He remained there for a day whi-

le I remained there on the other day, and he brought me the news about the revelation and other 

(matter), and I brought him (the news) like this. And we discussed that the Ghassanids were shoeing 

the horses in order to attack us. Id y companion once attended (the Apostle). and then came to me at 

night and knocked at my door and called me, and I came out to him, and he said: A matter of great 

importance has happened. I said: What is that? Have the Ghassanids come? He said: No, but even 

more serious and more significant than that: the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has divor-

ced his wives. I said: Hafsa has failed and has incurred loss. and I feared that it would happen. When 

it was dawn I observed the dawn prayer and dressed myself, and then came there (in the house of 

the Holy Prophet) and visited Hafsa, and she was weeping. I said: Has Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) divorced you (all)? She said: I do not know. He has, however, separated himself in his 

attic. I came to a black servant and said to him: Seek permission for 'Umar. He went in and then 

came to me and said: I made mention of you to him, but he kept quiet. I then went to the pulpit and 

sat there, and there was a group of people sitting by it and some of then were weeping. I sat there for 

some time, until I was overpowered (by that very idea) which was in my mind. I then came back to 

the boy and said to him: Seek permission for Umar. He went in and came to me and said: I made 

mention of you to him but he kept quiet. I was about to turn back when the boy called me and said: 

Go in; permission has been granted to you. I went in and greeted Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and he was reclining against the couch of mat and it had left its marks upon his side. I 

said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He raised his head towards me and said: No. 

I said: Allah is the Greatest. Messenger of Allah, I wish if you had seen how we the people of Quraish 

had domination over women but when we came to Medina we found people whom their women 

dominated. So our women began to learn from their women. One dily I became angry with my wife 

and she began to retort upon me. I did not approve that she should retort upon me. She said: You do 

not like that I should retort upon you, but, by Allah. the wives of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon 

him) retort upon him and any one of them separates herself from him for a day until night. I said: He

who did that amongst them in fact failed and incurred loss. Does any of them feel sate from the 

wrath of Allahupon her due to the wrath of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and she has 

certainly perished. Allah's Messtnger (may peace be upon him) smiled, I said: Messenger of Allah, I 

visited Hafsa and said: (The behaviour) of your companion ('A'isha) may not mislead you, If she is 

more graceful than you and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) than you.

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled for the second time. I said: Allah's Messenger, 

way I talk to you about agreeable things? He said: Yes. I sat down and lifted my head (to see things) 

in the house and, by Allah, I did not see anything significant besides three hides. I said: Messenger of 

Allah, supplicate the Lord that He should make (life) prosperous for your Ummah as He has made 

plentiful for the people of Persia and Rome (in spite of the fact) that they do no, worship Allah, the 

Exalted and Majestic, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) sat up an I then said: Ibn Khattab, do you 

doubt that they are a nation whom their nice things have been given immediately in the life of this 

world. I said: Allah's Messenger! seek pardon for me. And he (Allah's Messenger) had taken an oath 

that he would not visit them for a month due to extreme annoyance with them until Allah showed 

His displeasure to him (Allah's Messenger). Zuhri said: 'Urwa informed me that 'A'Isha (Allah be 

pleased with her) said: When twenty-nine nights were over, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) visited me, and he began (his visit) with me. I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath 

that you would not visit us for a month, while you have visited after I have counted only twenty-nine 

(nights). Thereupon he said: The month may also be of twenty-nine (days). He then said: 'A'isha, I am 

going to talk to you about a matter, and you should not be hasty in it (and do not give your final de-

cision) until you have consulted your parents. He then recited this verse to me:" O Prophet, say to 

your wives" till he reached" mighty reward" (xxxiii. 28). 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: By 

Allah, he knew that my parents would not allow me to separate from him. I said: Is there any need to 

consult my parents in this matter? I in fact choose Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) and the abode in the Hereafter. Ma'mar said: Ayyub reported to me that 'A'isha said: Don't in-

form your wives that I have chosen you, whereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said:

whom my companions visit. So better spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a 

blind man and yon can put off your garments. And when the 'Idda is over, inform me. She said: 

When my period of 'Idda was over, I mentioned to him that Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and Jahm had 

sent proposal of marriage to me, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: As for 

Abu Jahm, he does not put down his staff from his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiya, he is a poor man 

having no property; marry Usama b. Zaid. I objected to him, but he again said: Marry Usama; so I 

married him. Allah blessed there in and I was envied (by others).

Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband divorced her during the life time of Allah's Prophet 

(may peace be upon him) and gave her a meagre maintenance allowance. When she saw that, she 

said: By Allah, I will inform Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and if maintenance allo-

wance is due to me then I will accept that which will suffice me, and if it is not due to me, I will not 

accept anything from him. She said: I made a mention of that to Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and he said: There is neither maintenance allowance for you nor lodging.

Book 009, Number 3514: 

Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband al-Makhzulmi divorced her and refused to pay her

of Ibn Umm Maktum and live with him for he is a blind man and you can put off your clothes in his 

house (i. e. you shall not face much difficulty in observing purdah there).

Walid along with a group of persons visited Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the hou-

se of Maimuna and they said: Abu Hafs has divorced his wife with three pronouncements; is there 

any maintenance allowance due to her? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: No maintenance allowance is due to her, but she is required to spend the 'Idda; and he sent her 

the message that she should not be hasty in making a decision about herself and commanded her to 

move to the house of Umm Sharik, and then sent her the message that as the first immigrants (fre-

quently) visit the house of Umm Sharik, she should better go to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, the 

blind, (and further said: In case you put off your head-dress, he (Ibn Umm Makhtum) will not see

divorce which was still left from the (irrevocable) divorce; and he commanded al-Harith b. Hisham 

and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a to give her maintenance allowance. They said to her: By Allah, there is no 

maintenance allowance for you, except in case you are pregnant. She came to Allah's Apostle (may 

peace he upon him) and mentioned their opinion to him, whereupon he said: There is no mainte-

nance allowance for you. Then she sought permission to move (to another place), and he (the Holy 

Prophet) permitted her. She said: Allah's Messenger, where (should I go)? He said: To the house of 

Ibn Umm Maktum and, as he is blind, she could put off her garmeqts in his presence and he would 

not see her. And when her 'Idda was over. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her to 

Usama b. Zaid. Marwan (the governor of Medina) sent Qabisa b. Dhuwaib in order to ask her about 

this hadith, and she narrated it to him, whereupon Marwan said: We have not heard this hadith but 

from a woman. We would adopt a safe (path) where we found the people. Fatima said that when 

these words of, Marwan were conveyed to her. There is between me and you the word of Allah, the 

Exalted and Majestic: Do" not turn them out" of their houses. She asserted: This is in regard to the re-

vocable divorce what new (turn can the event take) after three pronouncements (separation between 

irrevocable). Why do you say there is no maintenance allowance for her if she is not pregnant? Then 

on what ground do you restrain her?

Abu Jahm is concerned, he is a great beater of women, but Usama b. Zaid... She pointed with her

five si's of barley. I said: Is there no maintenance allowance for me but only this, and I cannot even

Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: How many pronouncements of divorce have been 

made for you? I said: Three. He said what he ('Ayyish b. Abu Rabi'a) had stated was true. There is no 

maintenance allowance for you. Spend 'Idda period in the house of your cousin, Ibn Umm Maktum. 

He is blind and you can put off your garment in his presence. And when you have spent your Idda

as it was evening I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and asked him about it, and 

he gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry when I had given birth to a child and as-

ked me to marry if I so liked. Ibn Shihab said: I do not find any harm fur her in marrying when she

house of Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) and began to discuss about the woman who gave 

birth to a child a few nights after the death of her husband. Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with then) ) 

said: Her 'Idda is that period which is longer of the two (between four months and ten days and the 

birth of the child, whichever is longer). AbuSalama, however said: Her period of 'Idda is over (with 

the birth of the child), and they were contending with each other over this issue, whereupon Abu 

Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) said: I subscribe (to the view) held by my nephew (i. e. Abu Sa-

lama). They sent Kuraib (the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas) to Umm Salama to ask her about it. He came

Jahsh (Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died and she sent for perfume and applied it and

developed some trouble in her eye; should we apply collyrium to it? Thereupon Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) said: No (repeating it twice or thrice, saying only, NO" all the time). Then 

he said: It is only four mouths and ten days, whereas in the preIslamic period none of you threw 

away the dung until one year had passed. Humaid said: I said to Zainab: What is this throwing of 

dung until a year is passed? Zainab said: When the husband of a woman died, she went into a hut 

and put on her worst clothes, and did not apply perfume or something like it until a year was over. 

Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over

of collyrium, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: One among you used to 

spend one year in a dungeon dressed in worst clothes. (And at the end of this period) she threw dung 

at the dog which happened to pass that way and then she came out (of her 'Idda). Can't she (wait)

reecorded in it:" And subsequebtly the separation became the practice of al-Mutala'inain." And this 

addition was also made:" She was pregnant and her son was ascribed to her, and it became customa-

ry that such (a son) would inherit her and she would inherit him in the share prescribed by Allah for 

her.

Book 009, Number 3555: 

Ibn Shihab narrated about the invokers of curses and the practice of (li'an) based on the authority 

of Sahl b. Sa'd, of the tribe of Sa'ida. that a person from the Ansar came to Allah's Apostle (may peace 

be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, tell me about the person who found a man with his wife. 

The remaining part of the hadith is the same (but) with this addition: They invoked curses in the 

mosque and I was present there. And he narrated in the hadith: He divorced her with three pro-

nouncements before Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded him (to get separati-

on). He separated from her in the presence of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon 

he said: There is a separation between the invokers of curses.

Book 009, Number 3556: 

Sa'id b Jubair reported: I was asked about the invokers of curses during the reign of Mus'ab (b. Zu-

bair) whether they could separate (themselves by this process). He said: I did not understand what to

say. So I went to the house of Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca. I said to his servant: 

Seek permission for Me. He said that he (Ibn 'Umar) had been taking rest. He (Ibn 'Umar) heard my 

voice. and said: Are you Ibn Jubair? I said: Yes. He'said: Come in. By Allah, it must be some (great) 

need which has brought you here at this Hour. So I got in and found him lying on a blanket reclining 

against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm. I said: O Abu'Abd al-Rahman, should there be se-

paration between the invokers of curses? He said: Hallowed be Allah, yes, The first one who asked 

about it was so and so. he said: Messenger of Allah, tell me If one of us finds his wife committing 

adultery: what should he do? If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet that is also (so-

mething great) (which he cannot afford to do). Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon him) kept quiet 

(or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him (Allah's Messenger) and said: I 

have been involved in that very cage about which I had asked you Allah the Exalted and Majestic 

then revealed (these) verses of Surah Nur:" Those who accuse their wives" (verse 6), and he (the Holy 

Prophet) recited them to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the 

torment of the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. He said: No, by Him Who sent 

you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her. He (the Holy Prophet) then called her (the wife of that 

person who had accused her) and admonished her, and exhorted her, and informed her that the tor-

ment of this world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. She said: No, by Him Who sent 

thee with Truth, he is a liar. (it was) the man who started the swearing of oath and he swore in the 

name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful. and at the fifth turn he said: Let there be 

curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then the woman was called and she swore four 

times in the name of Allah that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): 

Let there be curse upon her if he were among the truthful. He (the Holy Prophet) then effected sepa-

ration between the two. A hadith like this is narrated by Ibn Numair with a slight variation of words.

Book 009, Number 3557: 

Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) say-

ing to the invokers of curse: Your account is with Allah. One of you must be a liar. You have now no 

right over this woman. He said: Messenger of Allah, what about my wealth (dower that I paid her at 

the time of marriage)? He said: You have no claim to wealth. If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the re-

compense for your having had the right to intercourse with her, and if you tell a lie against her, it is 

still more remote from you than she is. Zuhair said in his narration: Sufyan reported to us on the au-

thority of 'Amr that he had heard Sa'id b Jubair saying: I heard Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with 

them) saying that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said it.

Book 009, Number 3558: 

Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) ef-

ger. By Allah, I will definitely ask about him from Allah's Mescenger (may peace be upon him). On

killed, you would kill him, and if he were to keep quiet. he would consume anger, whereupon he

name of Allah that he was one of the truthful and then invoked curse for the fifth time saying: Let 

there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then she began to invoke curse. Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her: just wait (and curse after considering over it), but 

she refused and invoked curse and when she turned away, he (Allah's Apostle) said: It seems that this

Bara'b Malik from the side of his mother. And he was the first person who invoked curse (li'an) in Is-

lam. He in fact invoked curse upon her. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: See to her 

if she gives birth to a white-complexioned child having dark hair and bright eyes; he must be the 

son of Hilal b. Umayya; and if she gives birth to a child with dark eyelids, curly hair and lean shanks, 

he must be the offspring of Sharik b. Sahma. He said: I was informed that she gave birth to a child

'A'isha (Allah be pjeased with her) reported that Barira came to her in order to seek her help in se-

curing freedom, but she had (so far) paid nothing out of that sum stipulated in the contract. 'A'isba

contract) on your behalf (for purchasing your freedom), then I shall have the right in your inheri-

tance. (If they accepted it) I am prepared (to make this payment). Barira made a mention of that to

You for the sake of Allah, she may do it, but the right of inheritance will be ours. She (Hadrat 'A'isha)

made contract with me (for granting freedom) for nine 'uqiyas (of silver) payable in nine years, one 

'uqiya every year. Help me (in making this payment). I said to her: If your family so desires, I am pre-

pared to make them the full payment in one instalment, and thus secure freedom for you, but the 

right of inheritance will vest in me, if I do so. She (Barira) made a mention of that to her family, but

ble (they will never agree to it). And as she was saying it, Allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) 

heard, and he asked me, I informed him and he said: Buy her and emancipate her, and let the right of 

inherit- ance vest in them, for they cannot claim it (rightfully) since the right of inherritance vests 

with one who emancipates (the slave; therefore, these people have no right to lay such false claims). 

And I did so. She ('A'isha) said: Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) delivered a sermon 

in the evening. He extolled Allah and praised Him with what He deserves, and then said afterwards,: 

What has happened to the people that they lay down conditions which are not found in the Book of 

Allah? And the condition which is not found in the Book of Allah is invalid, even if its number is one 

hundred. The Book of Allah is more true (than any other deed) and the condition laid down by Allah 

is more binding (than any other condition). What has happened to the people among you that so-

meone among you says:" Emancipate so and so, but the right of inheritance vests in me"? Verily, the 

right of inheritance vests in one who emancipates.

tain her matrimonial alliance or break it after emancipation). She (taking advantage of the option) 

opted for herself (the severing of matrimonial alliance). 'A'isha said: The people used to give her cha-

Introduction 

Honesty in commercial dealings is more strictly enjoined by Islam than by any other religion. It is 

because Islam is a religion which regulates and directs life in all its departments. It is not to be regar-

ded, like the modern man's religion. as a personal, private affair, which has nothing to do with his 

economic and political life. It is not merely a body of dogmas or a bundle of rites and rituals; it is a 

practical code which governs life in all its spheres. Its laws are as effectively operative in our com-

merce and politics as in our domestic life and social relations. Islam censures political chicanery and 

economic exploitation as strongly as social excesses and individual dishonesty. Indeed, a true Islamic 

society is based upon honesty, justice and fraternity, and is absolutely intolerant of dishonesty in all 

its various forms. That is the reason why perfect honesty in business and truthfulness in trade are 

much emphasised by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). It will not be an exaggeration to 

say that absolute honesty in business and commerce is really an Islamic concept. The Hindus and 

Jews were (and still, are) worshippers of the Mammon. Both of them have been mercenary nations, 

notorious for their greed. The pre-Islamic Christians. too, did not possess any high standard of busi-

ness morality. It was Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) who, on the one hand, urged his 

followers to adopt trade as their profession, and, on the other band, exhorted them to observe truth-

fulness and honesty in their business transactions. 

Islam lays the greatest emphasis on Qat Haldl (food earned through lawful means). The pious 

among us believe that just as nasty food spolis our physical health, similarly. food earned through 

unlawful means spoils our spiritual and moral health. A man who liver on income derived through 

illicit means and fraudulent practices cannot be morally advanced and spiritually elevated. If we try 

to comprehend the exact, implications of the term Haram (unlawful) we can form an idea of the 

high standard of morality on which Islam wants us to conduct our business. And, if business is con-

ducted strictly in accordance with the Islamic principles of commerce, there can be absolutely no 

scope for any kind of commercial dishonesty varying from the simplest and most glaring type of 

business fraud to the most cunning and subtle type of profiteering which is often masked under a 

semblance of honesty. 

Islam is most vehement in its condemnation of commercial dishonesty. It denounced, in the stron-

gest possible terms, all sorts of deceitful dealings and illegal profits. It has disallowed all transactions 

not based upon justice and fairplay The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), while reprimanding 

the dishonest dealer, said:" Laisa minna man gashshdna" (Whosoever deceives us is not one of us). 

According to Imam Ghazali, a Muslim who makes up his mind to adopt trade as a profession or to 

set up his own business should first acquire a thorough understanding of the rules of business tran-

sactions codified in the Islamic Shari'ah. Without such understanding he will go astray and fail into 

serious lapses making his earning unlawful. No people in the world have ever attached so much im-

900 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 10: THE BOOK OF TRANSACTIONS (KITAB AL-BUYU`)

portance to lawful trading as did the early Muslims, nor has any other nation evinced such a dread 

of unlawful trading as they did. That is why al-Ghazali said stress on a clear understanding of the 

rules and laws governing business transactions as a necessary prerequisite to adopting trade or busi-

ness as a profession. 

The Holy Qur'an has stressed the importance of fairness in business:" And, O my people, give full 

measure and weight justly, and defraud not men of their things, and act not corruptly in the land 

making mischief. What remains with Allah is better for you, if you are believers" (xi. 85-86). 

In these words addressed by Hadrat Shu'aib to his people, the Holy Qur'an enunciates the funda-

mental principles of commerce as follows 

To give just measure and weight. 

Not to withhold from the people the things that are their due. 

Not to commit evil on the earth with the intent of doing mischief. 

To be contented with the profit that is left with us by God after we have paid other people their 

due. 

We are told in these verses that commerce can flourish under conditions of peace and security. 

The people are, therefore, warned not to disturb the peace of the land so that there is a free and un-

trammelled trade between different parts of the world. In commercial relations we are expected to 

be absolutely just and honest, liberally giving other people their due. We are not to be guilty of sel-

fish greed and not to indulge in profiteering; and we are told that the lawful profit which has God's 

blessings is the one that we are able to make through perfectly honest dealings with others. The in-

junctions contained in these Qur'anic verses and found elsewhere in the Holy Book close the door of 

all dishonest and unjust transactions. We should not forget that justice is a master virtue. If we give 

others just measure and just weight that tantamounts to saying that we should be fair and just in our 

dealings. 

A careful study of" Kitab al-Buyu`" (the book pertaining to business transactions) will reveal the 

fact that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) based business dealings strictly on truth and ju-

stice. He has strongly disapproved all transactions which involve any kind of injustice or hardship to 

the buyer or the seller. He wanted that both, the buyer and the seller, should be truly sympathetic 

and considerate towards each other. One should not take undue advantage of the simplicity or igno-

rance of the other. The seller should not think that he has unrestricted liberty to extort as much as 

possible from the buyer. He has to be just; he should take his own due and give the buyer what is his. 

Islam, which condemns every kind of injustice and exploitation in human relations, wants its fol-

lowers to conduct business in a sublime spirit of justice tempered with human kindness. The conduct 

of the seller in a transaction should be characterised not only by Insaf (justice), but also by Ihsan 

(magnanimity)." God will forgive the sins of a Muslim who absolves a fellow-Muslim from a sale-

contract not liked by the latter," says the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). 

901 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 10: THE BOOK OF TRANSACTIONS (KITAB AL-BUYU`)

All transactions should be based on the fundamental principle of" Ta'auanu ala birri wa't-taqwa" 

(mutual co-operation for the cause of goodness or piety). A transaction not based upon this sound 

principle is not lawful. Unlawful transactions are motivated by lust for money and an ignoble desire 

to build up prestige. Islam strikes at the root of the passion for money and suggests a different yard-

stick to measure the prestige of a person. The Holy Qur'an, on the one hand, condemns hoarding and 

the excessive love for wealth, and, on the other, declares virtue and piety to be the criterion for de-

termining a person's worth." Inna akramakum `ind-Allahi atqakum" (The noblest in the eyes of God 

is the most pious among you). Thus does Islam minimise in every possible way the temptation to ille-

gal trade and traffic. Let us now take note of the forms of business transactions which have been 

prohibited in Islam. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has not only disapproved of certain 

forms of business transactions, but has also laid down some basic conditions that should be fulfilled 

in every transaction if it is to be lawful. 

The following are some of these basic conditions: 

Things sold and money offered as their price to be lawfully acquired. The things sold and the mo-

ney to be offered as their price should both be lawfully acquired and clearly specified. This condition 

demands that the goods sold should have been lawfully obtained. One has no business to sell goods 

which one has stolen or which one has acquired in a fraudulent manner. nor should one purchase 

anything with the money which one has accepted as illegal gratification or has aceuired in some 

other deceitful way. This condition holds the buyer and the seller responsible for lawful possession of 

the goods on the partof one and of the money on the part of other. 

Goods not to be sold before obtaining their possession. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) 

has warned the Muslims against indulging in forward transactions which means selling goods befo-

re obtaining their possession." Whoever buys cereals shall not tell them until he has obtained their 

possession," says the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). According to Ibn 'Abbas, what applies to 

cereals also applies to other categories of goods. On another occasion the Holy Prophet (may peace 

be upon him) has said:" Bargain not about that which is not with you." 

Goods to be bought in the open market. Goods and commodities for sale should go into the open 

market, and the seller or his agents must be aware of the state of the market before proposals are 

made for the purchase by the buyers. The seller should not be taken unawares lest the buyers should 

take undue advantage of his ignorance of the conditions and prices prevailing in the market. 

No trade and traffic in things, the use of which is prohibited by Islam. A Muslim can trade in those 

goods and commodities only the use of which has been declared to be Halal (lawful). There can be 

no trade and traffic in things the use of which is proliibited by Islam. For example, there can be no 

trade in wine, swine, dead bodies of animals and idols. A devout Muslim merchant would not even 

traffic in thin and transparent stuff for ladies because the use of such stuff by ladies is unlawful. One 

cannot sell the carcass of an animal. He can, however, flay its skin which can be used for making 

shoes and which can therefore, be sold, but not the flesh of the dead animal. What is true of the usa-

ble skin of animals is also true of the tusks of an elephant.

BOOK 10: THE BOOK OF TRANSACTIONS (KITAB AL-BUYU`)

Prohibited forms of Business 

Monopoly business. As monopoly means concentration of supply in one hand, it leads to exploita-

tion of the consumers and the workers, it has, therefore, been declared unlawful by the Holy Prophet 

(may peace be upon him). Gigantic trusts. cartels and monopolies should not exist in the Islamic so-

ciety. The monopoly-dominated economic order betrays lack of harmony between private and social 

good and is, thus, a negation of the principle of maximum social advantage which the Islamic society 

sets out to achieve. 

Speculative business basd on selfish interest. Speculation means buying something cheap in bulk 

at a time and selling it dear at another and, thus, controlling the whole market to achieve personal 

gains. A close observation will reveal that speculators are primarily interested in private gains re-

gardless of the larger interest of the society. These speculators try to create artificial scarcity of goods 

and commodities and thereby create an inflationary pressure on the economy. As the poor masses 

have to pay for this. Islam has condemned such speculative business. 

Interest transactions. All transactions involving interest are forbidden in Islam. Some people find it 

hard to submit to the injunction prohibiting interest, because they think interest and profit earned in 

trade are similar. Capital invested in trade brings an excess called profit; invested in banking it 

brings interest. Why should one excess be considered lawful and the other unlawful? They fail to 

take note of the basic difference between the two. Trade involves risk of loss. Also in its case, it is not 

only the capital invested that brings profit which is equally the result of initiative, enterprise and ef-

ficiency of the entrepreneur. Hence its rate cannot be predetermined and fixed. Moreover, trade is 

productive. A person reaps a benefit after undergoing labour and hardship. It creates conditions of 

full employment and economic growth. It will also be noted that trade acts as one of the dominant 

factors in  the  process  of building up civilisation  through  co-operation  and  mutual  exchange of 

ideas. The spread of Islam and Islamic civilisation In the Far East has been mostly due to the efforts of 

Muslim traders. Interest has no redeeming feature at all. The fixed rate of profit which a person gets 

from a financial investment without any risk of loss and without augmenting it with human labour 

creates in man the undesirable weakness of miserliness and Shylockian selfishness and lack of sym-

pathy. In the economic sphere it initiates and aggravates crisis. 

Rightly, therefore, has Islam strictly prohibited all transactions based on it or involving it in some 

form or other. 

Advancing money on interest, keeping deposits in a bank for the sake of earning interest, or get-

ting concessions in rates of goods or commodities against advance payments of price, mortgaging 

and utilising an income-yielding property against a certain sum, to be returned in full when the 

property is redeemed and investing money in a trade against a predetermined and fixed rate of pro-

fit-are all unlawfnl business transactions because they involve Riba (interest) in some form or the 

other.

BOOK 10: THE BOOK OF TRANSACTIONS (KITAB AL-BUYU`)

Transactions similar (in nature) to gambling. The Arabic equivalent to gambling is Maisir which 

literarily means" getting something too easily"," getting a profit without working for it". The literal 

meaning of the term explains the principle on account of which gambling is prohibited in Islam. Any 

monetary gain which cornes too easily, so much so that one does not have to work for it, is unlawful. 

The most familiar form of gambling amang the Arabs in the days of the Holy Prophet (may peace 

be upon him) was gambling by casting of lots by means of arrows drawn from a bag. Some were 

blank and those who drew them got nothing. Others indicated prizes-big or small ones. Whether 

one got anything or nothing depended on pure luck. unless there was fraud on the part of someone 

concerned. The principle on which objection to gambling is based is that you gain what you have not 

earned, or lose on a mere chance. Dice, lottery, prize bonds and betting on horse races are to be held 

within the definition of gambling. 

Munabadha and Mulamasa. Islam recognises barter trade subject to the injunctions of the Qur'an 

and the Sunnah. In fact, Islam has closed all doors of dishonesty and deceit in business dealings. It 

has prohibited all forms of transactions which admit of fraud in the least degree. It has impressed on 

the traders that defective and worthless goods should not be given in exchange for good ones, and if 

there is a defect in the goods sold it must be pointed out and made manifest to the purchaser. The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:" The buyer and the seller have the option of can-

celling the contract as long as they have not separated; then. if they both speak the truth and make 

manifest, their transaction shall be blessed, and it they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their tran-

saction shall be obliterated". 

Besides issuing the instructions which govern all forms of trade, particularly barter trade, Islam 

has banned two forms of sale contract that were prevalent before Islam. These were Munabadha and 

Mulamasa.   In   neither   of   these   was   the   purchaser   offered   an   opportunity   to   examine   the   thing 

purchased. Munabadha means that the seller should throw the cloth to the buyer before he has care-

fully examined it. The very act of throwing the cloth will mean that the bargain has been struck. 

Mulamasa means touching the cloth without examining it, ie. the buyer was just supposed to touch 

the cloth to strike the bargain. Both these forms of transaction were prohibited because in either case 

the purchaser got no opportunity to examine the things sold to him, and the bargain was likely to 

prove unduly disadvantageous to one side. 

In fact, Islam demanlds that goods and commodities for we should go to the open market and the 

seller or his agents must be aware of the state of the market before proposals are made for the 

purchase of goods or communities in bulk. He should not be taken unawares lest advantage be taken 

of his ignorance of the state of the market, and the prevailing prices. All this is ver clearly laid down 

by the Prophet (may peace he upon him). 

As mentioned above, Islam tries to be fair to both parties to a transaction. Any step on the part of 

one, that is advantageous to him and disadvantageous to the other, is not permissible. The seller is 

expected to make the defects (if any) in the goods manifest to the buyer, nor is the buyer expected to 

take undue advantage of the ignorance of the seller.

Mozabana. It is the exchange of fresh fruits for dry ones in a way that the quantity of the dry fruit 

is actually measured and fixed, but the quantity of the fresh fruit to be given in exchange is guessed 

while it is still on the trees (Mishkat, 2710). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has forbid-

den this exchange because the quantity of the fruit on the trees cannot be definitely Determined and 

the transaction is just a leap into the dark. 

Mu'awama. It consists in selling the fruit on the trees for a period of one, two or three years even 

before it has made its appearance. It is prohibited because like Muzabana it is also a leap into the 

dark. Such transactions may result in bitterness and frustration. 

Bai' al-Gharar. It is to sell a thing which one doesn't have in one's possession, nor expects to bring 

it under one's control, e g. fish in the river, or birds in the air. Possession is one of the basic conditi-

ons of a sale. One cannot sell a thing which is not in one's possession. 

Bai' al-'Uryan. It is getting a thing against a nominal advance on the condition that if the bargain 

is struck, the advance will be adjusted and if the bargain is cancelled, the seller will riot return the 

advance. The advance being nominal, the buyer has practically no liability. He will abide by the con-

tract if he finds it advantageous to him and will withdraw himself from it otherwise. 

Bai' al-Mudtar. It is to buy a thing forcibly or to purchase a thing when its owner is compelled 

under stress of want to dispose it of. Instead of purchasing the thing, and taking undue advantage of 

the seller's helplessness, one should help him. Bai' alal-Bai' (sale over and above the sale of another). 

When one person has sold goods to another, a third Person should not upset the bargain trying to 

sell his own goods to the latter, offering them at lower rates or pointing out the defect in the goods 

already sold to him by the former." A Muslim should not purchase in opposition to his brother, nor 

should he send a marriage proposal over and above the proposal of another." 

Bai' al-Hast (i. e. sale by means of pebbles). The purchaser will tell the seller that when he will 

throw a pebble on his goods, the sale contract will be confirmed or the seller tell the purchaser that 

on whatever thing a pebble thrown by him falls will be sold to him. Sale contract is a serious matter 

and it should not be accomplished by such hit-and-miss methods like throwing the pebbles on the 

goods. A sale completed in this way may lead to injustice and hardship to one side and is conse-

quently prohibited. 

Sale of unripe fruit and unripe corn. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), according to Ha-

drat Anas (Allah be pleased with him), has prohibited the sale of grapes before they become dark and 

that of the corn before it ripens. Similarly, he has forbidden the sale of raw dates. The fruit of the 

date palms should not be sold until it becomes red or yellow. 

Here is a brief account of the sale transactions prohibited by Islam. If one ponders over these 

forms of transaction described above and described in greater detail in" Kitab al-Buyu," one can ar-

rive at the following conclusions: 

Islam insists upon absolute justice and fairplay in business dealings. 

905 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 10: THE BOOK OF TRANSACTIONS (KITAB AL-BUYU`)

According to Islam, a person who sacrifices his faith, and loses the good pleasure of his Lord to 

make a monetary gain has not made a good bargain. A Muslim will not go in for such a bad bargain. 

A Muslim merchant is not a worshipper of the Mammon with an inordinate love for money. He pri-

zes faith, piety and righteousness above all. 

Islam does not believe in the view that all is fair in business and that every kind of cleverness and 

deceit is justifiable in business transactions. Islam regards business or commerce as an economic ac-

tivity to be carried on in a spirit of humanity. tarianism and justice. It does not approve of the cut-

throat competition. Indeed, the very concept is un-Islamic. 

Islam expects the buyer and the seller to look upon each other as Muslim brethren or fellow hu-

man beings, each trying to go all his way to help and serve the other. It the seller happens to over-

charge the buyer, he, instead of feeling proud of his cleverness in doing so, should somehow com-

pensate him for the excessive payment received. 

All bargains that are clenched without giving the purchaser a fair chance of examining the things 

are prohibited because this amounts to denying him a right that was his due. 

Forcible transactions or transactions in which the buyer takes undue. advantage of the helpless-

ness or misery of the seller are also discouraged. 

Islam has prohibited traffic in wine, swine, dead bodies of animals and other goods the use of 

which has been declared to be Haram (unlawful). 

It has also forbidden trading in things that have a debasing or vitiating influence on the Muslim 

society.

purposes, whereupon he said: No, it is forbidden, Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)

Abu'l-Ash'ath, and he sat down. I said to him: Narrate to our brother the hadith of Ubada b. Samit. He 

said: Yes. We went out on an expedition, Mu'awiya being the leader of the people, and we gained a 

lot of spoils of war. And there was one silver utensil in what we took as spoils. Mu'awiya ordered a 

person to sell it for payment to the people (soldiers). The people made haste in getting that. The news

at, and barley by barley, and dates by dates, and salt by salt, except like for like and equal for equal. 

So he who made an addition or who accepted an addition (committed the sin of taking) interest. So

Why did you do that? Go back and return that, and do not accept but weight, for weight, for I used

(religious verdict). He said: By Allah, someone of the boy-servants of Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) brought dates, but he refused to accept them (on the plea) that those did not seem to be 

of the dates of our land. He said: Something had happened to the dates of our land, or our dates. So I 

got these dates (in exchange by giving) excess (of the dates of our land), whereupon he said: You 

made an addition for getting the fine dates (in exchange) which tantamounts, to interest; don't do 

that (in future). Whenever you find some doubt (as regards the deteriorating quality of) your dates, 

sell them, and then buy the dates that you like.

Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about this exchange, and he said: Whate-

ver is addition is an' interest. I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn 

'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar). He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him). There came to him the owner of a date-palm with one sa' of fine dates, 

and the dates of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) were of that colour. Allah's Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with two sa's of (inferior da-

tes) and bought one sa' of (these fine dates), for that is the prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the 

market and that is the price (of the fine quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) said: Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do 

it (i. e. exchange superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for ano-

ther commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you like. Abu 

Sa'ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there is the possibility (of 

the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is exchanged for gold having different 

qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn 'Umar and he forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn 

'Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them). He (the narrator) said: Abu as-Sahba' narrated to me: He asked

and I reached Medina well in advance of other people, until I reached my destination. There my ma-

ternal uncle met me and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. 

He reproved me in this connection. He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead of the 

caravan) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) inquired of me whether I had married a virgin 

or a non-virgin. I said to him: I have married a non-virgin. He said: Why did you not marry a virgin 

who would have played with you and you would have played with her? I said to him: Allah's Mes-

senger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have small sisters to (look after), so I did not like 

the idea that I should marry a woman who is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners 

and look after them properly. So I have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after 

them and teach them manners, When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina, I 

went to him in the morning with the camel. He paid me its price and returned that (the camel) to 

me.

Book 010, Number 3889: 

Jabir reported: We went from Mecca to Medina with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

when my camel fell ill, and the rest of the hadith is the same. (But it in also narrated in it: ) He (the 

Holy Prophet) said to me: Sell your camel to me. I said: No, but it is yours. He said: No. (it can't be), 

but sell it to me. I said: No, but, Allah's Messenger, it is yours. He said: No, it can't be, but sell it to me. 

I said: Then give me an 'uqaya of gold for I owe that to a person and then it would be yours. He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: I take it (for an 'uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina on it. As I reached Medina, 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Bilal: Give him an 'uqiya of gold and make some 

extra payment too. He (Jabir) said: He gave me an 'uqiya of gold and made an addition of a qirat. He 

(Jabir) said: The addition made by Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was with me (as a sa-

cred trust for belssing) and lay with me in a pocket until the people of Syria took it on the Day of 

Harra.

Introduction 

Inheritance is the entry of living persons into possession of dead persons' property and exists in 

some form wherever the institution of private property is recognised as the basis of the social and 

economic system. The actual forms of inheritance and the laws governing it, however, differ accor-

ding to the ideals of different societies. 

The law of inheritance in Islam is based upon five main considerations: 

To break up the concentration of wealth in individuals and spread it out in society. 

To respect the property right of ownership of an individual earned through honest means. 

To hammer in the consciousness of man the fact that man is not the absolute master of wealth he 

produces but he is its trustee and is not, therefore, authorised to pass it on to others as he likes. 

To consolidate the family system which is the social unit of an Islamic society. 

To give incentive to work and encourage economic activity as sanctioned by Islam. 

In the pre-Islamic world and even in modern societies the law of inheritance has so many evils in 

it, which may be summed up in the following points: 

Women had been completely denied the share of inheritance. They were rather regarded as part 

of the property of the deceased and, therefore, their right to property by inheritance was out of ques-

tion. 

In pre-Islamic Arabia and other countries where there had been tribal societies not only women 

were deprived of the right of inheritance but even weak and sick persons and minor children were 

given no share in it, as the common principle of inheritance was that he alone is entitled to inherit 

who wields the sword. 

Then in certain societies there had been existing the law of primogeniture and it exists even today 

in some of the so-called civilised parts of the world which entitles only the eldest son to inherit the 

whole of the father's property or to get the lion's share. 

Islam introduced so many reforms in the laws of inheritance which can be succinctly summed up 

as follows. 

It defined and determined in clear-cut terms the share of each inheritor and imposed limits on the 

right of the property-owner to dispose of his property according to his whim and caprice. 

It made the female, who had been prevously thought a chattel, the co-sharer with the male and 

thus not only restored her dignity, but safeguarded her social and economic rights. 

It laid the rules for the break-up of the concentrated wealth in the society and helped in its proper 

and equitable distribution amongst a large number of persons.

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 11:THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE RULES OF INHERITANCE (KITAB AL-FARAI`D)

It gave a death-blow to the law of primogeniture and thus provided the democratic basis for the 

division of the property of the deceased. 

The above are some of the distinguishing features of the Islamic law of inheritance. While laying 

down the rules for the distribution of the estate of the deceased, the first principle to be observed is 

that the property both movable and immovable can be distributed after meeting the following obli-

gations: 

funeral expenses; 

clearing off the debts incurred by the deceased; 

payment of bequest, if any, to the extent of one-third of the total assets. It may be remembered that 

the Mahr of the wife, if it had not been paid, is included in the debt. Moreover, it is not lawful to 

make a bequest in favour of a person who is entitled to a share in the inheritance. 

Four persons cannot get inheritance: 

(a) a fugitive slave who has fled away from his master, 

(b) one who has murdered one's predecessor intentionally or unintentionaly 

(c) one who professes a religion other than Islam, 

(d) one living in Dar-ul-Harb cannot inherit the property of one living in Dar-ul-Islam and vice 

versa. 

According to Islam, the heirs have been divided into three classes. 

(A) Dhaw-u'l-Fara'id are those persons who have a right to definite shares in assets left by the de-

ceased. These sharers are twelve in number; four males: father, grandfather, uterine brothers and 

husband; and eight females: wife, single daughter, son's daughter, mother, grandmother, full sister, 

consanguine sister, uterine sister. 

Father's share is one-sixth when the deceased leaves a son or a son's son, but if the deceased is not 

survived by a son or grandson his father will, in addition to this share (one-sixth), also get a share of 

being 'Asaba. 

The grandfather's share is like that of father's share but in three conditions: 

According to Imam Bukhiri and Imam Muslim, the presence of father deprives even the brothers 

of their share in the inheritance. but this is not the case with the grandfather. Imam Abu Hanifa is of 

the opinion that the presence of grandfather deprives the brother of his share in the inheritance. 

If the father of the deceased is alive, then the share of the mother is of what is left from the share 

of the wife of the deceased. The presence of grandfather does not reduce the share of the mother of 

the deceased. 

The grandmother of the deceased has no share in the presence of the father of the deceased but 

she has a share in the presence of the grandfather. 

971 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 11:THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE RULES OF INHERITANCE (KITAB AL-FARAI`D)

The third set of sharers are uterine brothers and sisters. They are entitled to one-sixth if their 

number is one, and one-third if they are more than one. 

The husband's share is one-half of the property of the deceased wife if she has no children, but in 

case of children it is one-fourth. 

The wife is entitled to one-fourth if the husband dies childless; otherwise it is one-eighth. 

Real daughter: one-half when alone, and two-thirds if more than one. If the deceased is survived 

by a male child also. the daughters are then treated as Asaba and the male child would get double of 

what falls to the lot of daughters. The granddaughters stand on the same level as daughters. But in 

case the deceased is survived by one real daughter and one or more than one granddaughter they 

would get one-sixth. The granddaughter is not entitled to any share if the deceased is survived by a 

son, but if he is survived by grandsons and granddaughters, they would be treated as 'Asaba and the 

male grandchild would get double of what goes to the female grandchild. 

Full sister gets one-half if she is alone, and two-thirds if they are more than one. 

Consanguine sister is entitled to one-half if one, and two thirds if more. 

Mother is entitled to one-sixth when she has a child or grandchild, and in case of being childless 

she gets one-third of the share. 

If the deceased is survived either by paternal grandmother or maternal grand- mother or even by 

both, they are entitled to one-sixth. The grandmother (maternal) is deprived of her share if the mo-

ther of the deceased is alive; and if father is alive the paternal grandmother is deprived of this share. 

(B) When the heirs of the first group have received the respective shares, the residue of the assets 

falls to the share of those relatives who are called Asaba which, according to the Shari'ah, implies 

those relatives in whose line of relationship no female enters. This is the second group of inheritors. 

There is no fixed share of the 'Asabat. If the deceased is not survived by any Dhaw-u'l-Fara'id, the 

whole of the property falls to their share; and If Dhaw-u'I. Fara'id are there to get their due share, 

the residue will be taken by the Asabat. The following are the 'Asabat: 

Son: He is the first to get the residue in order of succession. The daughters are entitled to half of 

the share as given to the son. The grandsons are not entitled to any share in the presence of the son. 

If the son is not living, then the grandson is entitled to a share in the inheritance. If there are more 

than one son, the inheritance will be distributed equally amongst them. 

The father, grandfather and the great-grandfather are included in the category of Dhaw-u'l-Fa-

ra'id. If, however, the deceased is not survived by category of a son, grandson of great-grandson, 

then the father will fall under the category of 'Asaba, and, in the absence of the father, the grandfa-

ther assumes that position. 

If the deceased is not survived by son, or grandson or father or grandfather, i. e. none amongst the 

'Asabat, then the brother, and in the absence of brother his son, and in the absence of son, his grand-

972 / 1800

BOOK 11:THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE RULES OF INHERITANCE (KITAB AL-FARAI`D)

son will be entitled to share in the inheritance as 'Asaba and the female would also join them in sha-

re claiming half of the share as compared with male. 

If unfortunately the deceased is survived by none of the above-mentioned relatives amongst the 

'Asabat, then consanguine brother will be entitled to share in the inheritance and he will be prefer-

red to full brother's son. 

Then comes the turn of full paternal uncle. 

(C)   The   last   category   of   inheritors   are   known   ad   Dhaw-u'l   Arham,   i.   e.   relations   connected 

through females, but it is in extremely rare cases that they get any share in the inheritance. The fol-

lowing relatives come under this category. 

The son of the daughter and daughter of the daughter. 

The son of the daughter of the son, and daughter of the daughter of the son and their children. 

Maternal grandfather, maternal grandfather of the father, the grandfather of the mother, mater-

nal grandfather of the mother, the grandmother of the mother, the children of the sisters, the sisters 

of the father and those of the mother, etc.

BOOK 12: THE BOOK OF GIFTS (KITAB AL-HIBAT)

Introduction 

A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of property, movable and immovable, from one 

person to the other willingly and without any reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as 

donor (Wahib), and the thing transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is 

known as Mauhub lahu (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar'i'ah are Nihla or 

'Atiyya. 

The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders the possession of the thing donated. 

Moreover,  the  declaration  of  donation  should  be  in   clear  terms  without  any  ambiguity   (around 

them). This act of donation is based on the following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon 

him):" Give presents to one another for this would increase your mutual love." This not only implies 

the legality of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement 

amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. 

The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by any person capable of making a con-

tract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid, and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond 

one-third of the assets of the deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be 

made to a living person and not to one who is dead. 

The Shari'ah imposes certain restrictions on the property which is to be donated. In the first place, 

the property must be in existence at the time when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesa-

me or of butter in the milk would not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked 

except in some extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by 

him from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari'ah. The right to revoke 

a gift is called Raj'. This act of revocation can be done with the decree of a competent court. 

Chapter 1: Disapproval of beuying the donated proper-

ty by the donor himself 

Book 012, Number 3949: 

Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I donated a pedigree horse in the path of 

Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah's 

Menengsr (may peace be upon him) about it, whereupon he said: Don't buy it and do not get back 

your charity, for one who gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has 

been narrated on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this 

addition:" Don't buy that even if he gives you for one dirham."

According to the Shar'iah, one is entitled to make a will for one-third of one's property and not 

beyond that so that the rights of the legal heirs are not adversely affected. 

" Again, the principle on which the legality of a testamentary disposition is based being in defean-

ce pro tanto of the rights of heirs generally the law requires that such disposition should be for the 

benefit of non-heirs alone. 

" A further reason why a bequest in favour of an heir is not allowed is that it would amount to gi-

ving preference to some heirs over others, thus defeating the spirit of the law which has fixed the 

portion of each in the inheritance and causing disputes among persons related to one another. If the 

other heirs consent to a bequest to one of them or to a bequest of more than one-third of the estate, 

the above reasons no longer hold good and the bequest as made will be valid" (Abdur Rahim, The 

Principles of Muhammadan jurisprudence, pp. 311-2). 

It is, however, preferable and most advisable not to will away the property if the legal heirs are 

poor, because it manifests benevolence to the heirs who have superior claim to it from the relations 

in which they stand. 

Another principle which is observed in case of bequest is that the proprietary right of a legatee in 

a bequest is establislied if he accepts it.

Amir b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father (Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas): Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) visited me in my illness which brought me near death in the year of Hajjat-ul-

Wada' (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said: Allah's Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am 

afflicted and I am a man possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daugh-

ter. Should I give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of my 

property) as Sadaqa? He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity) and that is quite 

enough. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging from people; that you 

would never incur an expense seeking therewith the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded 

therefor, even for a morsel of food that you put in the mouth of your wife. I said: Allah's Messenger. 

would I survive my companions? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a 

deed by means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status (in re-

ligion) and prestige; you may survive so that people would benefit from you, and others would be 

harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah, complete for my Companions their migration, 

and not cause them to turn back upon their heels. Sa'd b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate. Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt grief for him as he had died in Mecca.

to provide them with mounts as they were going along with him in jaish al-'Usrah (the army of de-

stitutes or of meagre means or army setting out during the hard times and that is the occasion of the

them with mounts. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. 

And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a 

heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear 

that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to

Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels 

which he had bought from Sa'd), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: 

Verily Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride 

upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah's messenger 

(may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not 

leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his 

granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which

pugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would

old age." In the tradition transmitted on the authority of 'Isa (the words are):" If you burden him 

(with an unbearable burden), you should sell him (and get another slave who can easily undertake 

this burden)." In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Zuhair (the words are):" Help him in that

or help him." This hadith concludes with these words:" Do not burden him beyond his capacity."

Apostle (may peace be upon him) and made mention of that to him. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may

brothers of yours. Allah has placed them in your hand, and he who has his brother under him, he

Sahl b. Abu Hathma and Rafi' b. Khadij reported that 'Abdullah b. Sahl b. Zaid and Muhayyisa b. 

Mas'ud b. Zaid went out and as they reached Khaibar they were separated. Then Muhayyisa found 

'Abdullah b. Sahl having been killed. He buried him, and then came to Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him). They were Huwayyisa b. Mas'ud and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl, and he (the latter one) 

was the youngest of the people (those three who had come to seek an interview with the Holy Pro-

phet) began to talk before his Companions (had spoken). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak). So he kept quiet, and his 

companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he ('Abd al Rahman) spoke along with 

them and they narrated to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) the murder of 'Abdullah b. 

Sahl. Thereupon he said to them: Are you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to 

blood-wit) of your companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an 

oath on a matter which we have not witnessed? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will exo-

nerate themselves by fifty oaths. They said: How can we accept the oaths of people who are unbelie-

vers? When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he himself paid his blood-wit.

Book 016, Number 4120: 

Sahl. b. Abu Hathma and Rafi' b. Khadij reported that Muhayyisa b. Mas'ud and 'Abdullah b. Sahl 

went towards Khaibar and they separated near the palm-trees. 'Abdullah b. Sahl was killed. They ac-

cused the Jews (for this act). And there came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) his brother 

(the brother of the slain person) 'Abd al-Rahman and his cousins Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa; and 

'Abd al-Rahman talked to him about the matter pertaining to (the murder of) his brother, and he was 

the youngest among them. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Show regard 

for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin speaking. Then they (Huwayyisa and Mu-

hayyisa) spoke about the matter of their companion (murder of their cousin, 'Abdullah b. Sahl). The-

reupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for 

levelling the charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to 

you. They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Mes-

senger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those 

camels hit me with its leg.

na, and the brothers of the slain 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl. and Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa told Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) the case of 'Abdullah and the place where he had been murde-

red. Bushair reported on the authority of one who had seen Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) that he had said to them: You take fifty oaths and you are entitled to blood-wit of (one) slain 

among you (or your companion). They said: Messenger of Allah, we neither saw (with our own eyes 

this murder) nor were we present there. Thereupon (Allah's Messenger is reported to have said): 

Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by taking fifty oaths. They said: Allah's Messenger, how can 

we accept the oath of unbelieving people? Bushair said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) paid the blood-wit himself.

led, and (his dead body) had been thrown in a well or in a ditch. He came to the Jews and said: By 

Allah, it is you who have killed him. They said: By Allah, we have not killed him. He then came to his 

people, and made mention of that to them. Then came he and his brother Huwayyisa, and he was ol-

der than he, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl. Then Muhayyisa went to speak, and it was he who had ac-

companied ('Abdullah) to Khaibar, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to 

Muhayyisa: Observe greatness of the great (he meant the seniority of age). Then Huwayyisa spoke 

and then Muhayyisa also spoke. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: They 

should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared for war. Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) wrote about it to them (to the Jews). They wrote: Verily, by Allah, we have not 

killed him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Huwayyisa and Muhayyi-

sa and Abd al-Rahman: Are you prepared to take oath in order to entitle yourselves for the blood-wit 

of your companion? They said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will take oath (of their 

innocence). They said: They are not Muslims. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, 

himself paid the blood-wit to them and sent to them one hundred camels until they entered into

drink their milk and urine. They did so and were all right. They then fell upon the shepherds and 

killed them and turned apostates from Islam and drove off the camels of the Prophet (may peace be

make use of their milk and urine. They said: Yes. They set out and drank their (camels') milk and uri-

ne and regained their health. They killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This (news) rea-

ched Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he sent them on their track and they were

Safwan b. Ya'la b. Munya reported on the authority of his father that there came to Allah's Apostle 

(may peace be upon him) a person who had bitten the hand of another person and who had with-

drawn his hand (and as a result thereof) his foreteeth had fallen (those which had bitten). The Apost-

le of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned down his (claim), and said: Do you wish to bite as the 

camel bites?

Book 016, Number 4149: 

Safwan b. Ya'la b. Umayya thus reported from his father: I participated in the expedition to Tabuk 

with Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him). And Ya'la used to say: That was the most weighty of 

my deeds, in my opinion. Safwan said that Ya'la had stated: I had a servant; he quarrelled with ano-

ther person, and the one bit the hand of the other. ('Ata' said that Safwan had told him which one 

had bitten the hand of the other.) So he whose hand was bitten drew ill from (the mouth) of the one 

who had bitten it and (in this scuffle) one of his foreteeth was also drawn out. They both came to Al-

lah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he declared his (claim for the compensation of) tooth as

said: Messenger of Allah, will retribution be taken from so and so? By Allah, it shall not be taken 

from her (i. e. from Umm Haritha). Thereupon Allah's Apostle said: Hallowed be Allah. O Umm Ru-

bayyi', Qisas (retribution is a command, prescribed) in the Book of Allah. She said: No, by Allah, Qisas 

will never be taken from her; and she went on saying this until they (the relatives of the one who 

had been injured) accepted the blood-wit. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)

viz. Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l- Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes bet-

credness of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours. You will soon meet

strap and said: Allah's Messenger, this man has killed my brother. Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) said to him: Did you kill him? And the other man said: (In case he did not make a confes-

sion of this, I shall brine, a witness against him). He (the murderer) said: Yes, I have killed him. He 

(the Holy Prophet) said: Why did you kill him? He said: I and he won striking down the leaves of a 

tree and he abused me and enraged me, and to I struck his head with an axe and killed him, whe-

reupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Have you anything with you to pay blood-

wit on your behalf? He said: I do not possess any property but this robe of mine and this axe of mine. 

He (the Holy, Prophet) said: Do you think your people will pay ransom for you? He said: I am more 

insignificant among my people than this (that I would not be able to get this benefit from my tribe). 

He (the Holy Prophet) threw the strap towards him (the claimant of the blood-wit) saying: Take 

away your man. The man took him away, and as he returned, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) said: If he kills him, he will be like him. He returned and said: Allah's Messenger, it has reached 

me that you have said that" If he killed him, he would be like him." I caught hold of him according to 

your command, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don't you like that he 

should take upon him (the burden) of your sin and the sin of your companion (your brother)? He 

said: Allah's Apostle, why not? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be. upon him) said: If it is so, then 

let it be. He threw away the strap (around the offender) and set him free.

woman is to be paid by her relative on the father's side, and he (the Holy Prophet) made her sons and 

those who were with them her heirs. Hamal b. al-Nabigha al-Hudhali said: Messenger of Allah, why 

should I play blood-wit for one who neither drank, nor ate, nor spoke, nor made any noise; it is like 

a nonentity (it is, therefore, not justifiable to demand blood-wit for it). Thereupon Allah's Messenger

Introduction 

The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh. This word is the plural of Hadd, 

which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and hence a restrictive ordinance or sta-

tute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful. 

Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and the other Ta'zir. The 

Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. In Ta'zir, the court, is allo-

wed to use its discretion in regard to the form and measure in which such punishment is to be inflic-

ted. 

Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning, amputation of a limb or 

limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes. They are prescribed respectively for the following 

offences: adultery committed by married persons, theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander 

imputing unchastity to women. 

The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above mentioned crimes. 

These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which the crimes were committed, the 

nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal with which he committed the crime.

mit according to which it is imposed upon an of-

mitted theft, and said: Who will speak to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) about her? 

They said: Who dare it, but Usama, the loved one of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)? So 

Usama spoke to him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do you intercede 

regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah? He then stood up and addressed (people) 

saying: O people, those who have gone before you were destroyed, because if any one of high rank 

committed theft amongst them, they spared him; and it anyone of low rank committed theft, they in-

flicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Allah, if Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, were to 

steal, I would have her hand cut off. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Ibn Rumh (the 

words are):" Verily those before you perished."

Zaid, the loved one of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)? She was brought to Allah's Mes-

half). The colour of the face of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) changed, and he said: Do 

you intercede in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah? He (Usama) said: 'Messenger of Allah, 

seek forgiveness for me. When it was dusk. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and

they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed

unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female (they should receive) one hundred las-

hes and banishment for one year. And in case of married male committing adultery with a married 

female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.

Book 017, Number 4192: 

'Ubada b. as-Samit reported that whenever Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) received re-

velation, he felt its rigour and the complexion of his face changed. One day revelation descended 

upon him, he felt the same rigour. When it was over and he felt relief, he said: Take from me. Verily 

Allah has ordained a way for them (the women who commit fornication),: (When) a married man 

(commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried male with an unmarried woman, then 

in case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to

death). And in case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one 

year.

This hadith has been reported on the authority of Qatada with the same chain of transmitters ex-

lashed and stoned. There is neither any mention of one year nor that of one hundred.

Chapter 4: Stoning of a married adulterer 

Book 017, Number 4194: 

'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) and said: Verily Allah sent Muhammad (may peace be upon him) with truth and 

He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to 

him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) 

and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, 

the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Al-

lah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in 

Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there 

is pregnancy, or a confession.

committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away from him, He (again) came round facing 

him and said to him: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned 

away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are 

you married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Take him

this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the place of prayer (eit-

bore witness against his own self four times that he had committed adultery, whereupon Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Perhaps (you kissed her or embraced her). He said: No. by 

God, one deviating (from the path of virtue) has committed adultery. He then got him stoned (to 

death), and then delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of 

you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity of milk. 

By Allah, in case I get hold of him, I shall certainly punish him.

Jabir b. Samura reported that there was brought to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) a

and he was stoned. Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: We set out for Jihad in the 

cause of Allah and one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat and one of

ailment of his except that he has committed something about which he thinks that he would not be 

able to relieve himself of its burden but with the Hadd being imposed upon him. He (Ma'iz) came 

back to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he commanded us to stone him. We took him 

to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him. 

We attacked him with bones, with clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he 

came upon the ston ground (al-Harra) and stopped there and we stoned him with heavy stones of 

the Harra until he became motionless (lie died). He (the Holy Prophet) then addressed (us) in the 

evening saying Whenever we set forth on an expedition in the cause of Allah, some one of those 

connected with us shrieked (under the pressure of sexual lust) as the bleating of a male goat. It is es-

sential that if a person having committed such a deed is brought to me, I should punish him. He neit-

before. When it was the fourth time, Allah's Messenger (may, peace be upon him) said: From what 

am I to purify you? He said: From adultery, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked if he 

had been mad. He was informed that he was not mad. He said: Has he drunk wine? A person stood 

up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be

and he was stoned to death. The people had been (divided) into two groups about him (Ma'iz). One 

of them said: He has been undone for his sins had encompassed him, whereas another said: There is 

no repentance more excellent than the repentance of Ma'iz, for he came to Allah's Apostle (may pe-

ace be upon him) and placing his hand in his (in the Holy Prophet's) hand said: Kill me with stones. 

(This controversy about Ma'iz) remained for two or three days. Then came Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) to them (his Companions) as they were sitting. He greeted them with salutation 

and then sat down and said: Ask forgiveness for Ma'iz b. Malik. They said: May Allah forgive Ma'iz b.

Ma'iz. b. Malik. He (the Holy, Prophet) said: What has happened to you? She said that she had beco-

me pregnant as a result of fornication. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it you (who has done that)? She 

said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: (You will not be punished) until you deliver what is there 

in your womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her until she was delivered (of the child). He 

(that Ansari) came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said the woman of Ghamid has 

given birth to a child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her

the following day, he (Ma'iz) again came to him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adul-

tery. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned him away for the second time, and sent him 

to his people saying: Do you know if there is anything wrong with his mind. They denied of any such 

thing in him and said: We do not know him but as a wise good man among us, so far as we can jud-

ge. He (Ma'iz) came for the third time, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent him as he had done before. He 

asked about him and they informed him that there was nothing wrong with him or with his mind. 

When it was the fourth time, a ditch was dug for him and he (the Holy Prophet) pronounced judg- 

ment about him and he wis stoned. He (the narrator) said: There came to him (the Holy Prophet) a 

woman from Ghamid and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery, so purify me. He (the 

Holy Prophet) turned her away. On the following day she said: Allah's Messenger, Why do you turn 

me away? Perhaps, you turn me away as you turned away Ma'iz. By Allah, I have become pregnant. 

He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was 

delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given 

birth to. He said: Go away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came 

to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Al-

lah's Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the 

child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her 

chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone 

which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Al-

lah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid's) curse that he had huried upon her. The-

reupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made 

such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgi-

ven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.

(may peace be upon him) called her master and said: Treat her well, and when she delivers bring her 

to me. He did accordingly. Then Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) pronounced judgment 

about her and her clothes were tied around her and then he commanded and she was stoned to 

death. He then prayed over her (dead body). Thereupon Umar said to him: Allah's Apostle, you offer 

prayer for her, whereas she had committed adultery! Thereupon he said: She has made such a rep-

entance that if it were to be divided among seventy men of Medina, it would be enough. Have you

Is this the punishment that you find in your Book (Torah) as a prescribed punishment for adultery? 

They said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in 

the name of Allah Who sent down the Torah on Moses if that is the prescribed punishment for adul-

tery that you find in your Book. He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not 

have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). 

But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of 

any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless 

person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punish-

ment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with 

coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be

commanded and he (the offender) was stoned to death. Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down

should not grieve you..." up to" is vouchsafed unto you, accept it" (v. 41) 2176 It was said (by the

ate until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with provisions. Then Allah's Apostle (may

small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin. We all fourteen hundred persons perfor-

med ablution using the water in plenty. Then there came after that eight persons and they said: Is

The ablution has already been performed.

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

Introduction 

The word Jihad is derived from the verb jahada which means:" he exerted himself". Thus literally, 

Jihad means exertion, striving; but in juridico-religious sense, it signifies the exertion of one's power 

to the utmost of one's capacity in the cause of Allah. This is why the word Jihad has been used as the 

antonym to the word Qu, ud (sitting) in the Holy Qur'an (iv. 95). Thus Jihad in Islam is not an act of 

violence directed indiscriminately against the non-Muslims; it is the name given to an all-round 

struggle which a Muslim should launch against evil in whatever form or shape it appears. Qital fi 

sabilillah (fighting in the way of Allah) is only one aspect of Jihad. Even this qital in Islam is not an 

act of mad brutality. It has its material and moral functions, i. e. self-preservation and the preservati-

on of the moral order in the world. The verdict of all religious and ethical philosophies-ancient and 

modern-justify war on moral grounds. When one nation is assailted by the ambitions and cupidity of 

another, the doctrine of non-resistance is anti-social, as it involves non-assertion, not only of one's 

own rights, but of those of others who need protection against the forces of tyranny and oppression. 

A Muslim is saddled with the responsibilities to protect himself and all those who seek his protection. 

He cannot afford to abandon the defenceless people, old man, women and children to privation, suf-

fering and moral peril. Fighting in Islam, therefore, represents in Islamic Law what is known among 

Western jurists as" just war". 

The very first revelation in which the permission to wage war against the forces of evil sums up 

the aims and objects of qital in Islam: 

" Permitted'are those who are fought against, because they have been oppressed. and verily God is 

more Powerful for their aid. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because 

they said: 'Our Lord is Allah, ' for had it not been for 'Allah's repelling someone by means of others, 

cloisters and churches and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft-mentioned, would assuredly 

have been pulled down. Verily Allah helps one who helps Him. Lo! Allah is Strong. Almighty" (xxii. 

39. 41). 

These verses eloquently speak of 'the fact that it is neither for the acquisition of territory nor for 

the love of power and distinction that the Muslims have been permitted to raise arms against the 

enemy. They were allowed to do so because their very existence had been made difficult by the high-

handedness of the Meccans. The Holy Qur'an has elucidated this point in the following verse: 

" And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah and for the oppressed among men and 

women and children who say: Our Lord! take us forth from the town whereof the people are oppres-

sors and grant us from Thee a friend and grant us from Thee a helper" (iv. 75).

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

The war in Islam is waged with a view to securing liberty and freedom for those who are groaning 

under the oppression of heartless tyrants. It is the bounden duty of the Muslims to alleviate their suf-

ferings and create for them an atmosphere of peace and security. 

Then in the succeeding verse a distinction is also drawn between two types of war: one which is 

fought for the sake of Allah and the other which is waged for evil ends: 

" Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of devil. So 

fight against the friends of Satan; verily weak indeed is the strategy of the devil" (iv. 76). 

It has been made clear that those people who fight for self-glorification or for the exploitation of 

the weak are in fact friends of the devil; wheres those who raise arms to curb tyranny and aggressi-

on, to eradicate evil from the human society, fight in the way of Allah. Mere fighting is not, therefore, 

Jihad in Islam; it is the noble objective alone which makes it a sacred pursuit like devotion and pray-

er. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash'ari that once a man went to the Holy Prophet 

(may peace be upon him) and said: One man fights for the sake of spoils of war, the second one 

fights for fame and glory and the third to display his courage and skill; which among them is the 

fighter for the cause of Allah? Upon this the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) replied: He who 

fights with the sole objective that the word of Allah should become supreme is a Mujahid in the cau-

se of the Lord. 

A Mujahid is thus a noble person who offers his life for the achievement of lofty ends. He is actua-

ted by human considerations lifts arms not under the impulse of fury and revenge, but with will, 

fore-thought, tenacity and fellow-feeling, and his conduct bears the imprint of human intellect, hu-

man sympathy and sense of justice. 

The Holy Qur'an has explained this point in Sura Anfal in these words: 

" O you who believe, when you meet an enemy, be firm, and remember Allah much, that you may 

be successful. And obey Allah and His Apostle. And fall with no disputes, lest ye falter and your 

strength fail; but be steadfast! For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. Be not as those who 

came forth from their dwellings boastfully. And to be seen of men and debar (men) from the way of 

Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do" (viii. 45-46). 

Here the Muslims have been exhorted to observe five principles of war: 

Be steadfast in the face of the enemy. 

Have full reliance on the help of Allah and remember Him much. 

Have the unity of purpose and solidarity of corporate life always before your eyes. 

Be fully aware of the lofty purpose before you in fighting. 

Don't be proud and boastful in your attitude and behaviour. 

Islam has purified even war of all its cruelty and horrors and has made it a" reformative process" 

to deal with evil. The Holy Qur'an bserves: 

1067 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

" And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you and transgress not the limits. 

Verily Allah loves not the transgressors" (ii. 190). 

The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has given clear instructions about the behaviour of 

the Muslim army. He observed: 

" Set out for Jibad in the name of Allah and for the sake of Allah. Do not lay hands on the old ver-

ging on death, on women, children and babes. Do not steal anything from the booty and collect to-

gether all that falls to your lot in the battlefield and do good, for Allah loves the virtuous and the 

pious." 

So great is the respect for humanly feelings in Islam that even the wanton destruction of enemy's 

crops or property is strictly forbidden. The righteous Caliphs followed closely the teachings of Allah 

and those of His Apostle in letter and spirit the celebrated address which the first Caliph Abu Bakr 

(Allah be pleased with him) gave to his army while sending her on the expedition to the Syrian bor-

ders is permeated with the noble spirit with which the war in Islam is permitted. He said: 

" Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit 

treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor 

a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those 

which are fruitful. Slay not ary of the enemy's flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by peo-

ple who have devoted their lives to monast ic services; leave them alone" 

It is said that once at the time of conquest, a singing girl was brought to al-Muhajir b. Abu Umay-

ya who had been publicly singing satirical poems about Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muhajir got her hand am-

putated. When the Caliph heard this news, he was shocked and wrote a letter to Muhajir in the fol-

lowing words: 

" I have learnt that you laid hands on a woman who had hurled abuses on me, and, therefore, got 

her hand amputated. God has not sought vengeance even in the case of polytheism, which is a great 

crime. He has not permitted mutilation even with regard to manifest infidelity. Try to be considerate 

and sympathetic in your attitude towards others in future. Never mutilate, because it is a grave of-

fence. God purified Islam and the Muslims from rashness and excessive wrath. You are well aware 

of the fact that those enemies fell into the hands of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

who had been recklessly abusing him; who had turned him out of his home; and who fought against 

him, but he never permitted their mutilation." 

Another   letter  written  by  hadrat  'Umar  the Second  Caliph,  which  is  addressed  to   sa'd  b.  Abu 

Waqqas, speaks eloquently of the noble spirit with which the Muslims have bear exhorted to take up 

arms: 

" Always search your minds and hearts and stress upon your men the need of perfect integrity and 

sincerity in the cause of Allah. There should be no material end before them in laying down their li-

ves. but they abould deem it a means whereby they can please their Lord and entitle them. selves to 

His favour: such a spirit of selflessness should be inculcated in the minds of those who unfortunately 

1068 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

lack it. Be firm in the thick of the battle as Allah helps man according to the perseverance that he 

shows in the cause of His faith and he would be rewarded in accordance with the spirit of sacrifice 

which he displays for the sake of the Lord. Be careful that those who have been entrusted to your 

care receive no harm at your hands and are never deprived of any of their legitimate rights. 

Such in fact is the humane and noble attitude which Islam exhorts its followers to adopt on the 

battlefield where passions are generally let loose. It is an attitude the like of which is not to be found 

in the history of any other nation. Has the world any code of military ethics more noble and compas-

sionate than this?" The moral tone adopted by the Caliph Abu Bakr in his instructions to the Syrian 

army was," says a Christian historian," so unlike the principles of the Roman government that it must 

have commanded profound attention from the subject people-such a proclamation announced to 

Jews and Christians sentiments of justice and principles of toleration which neither Roman emperors 

nor orthodox bishops had ever adopted as the rule of conduct." 

Western scholars have indulged in a good deal of mud-slinging on the question of the use of the 

sword in Islam. But if one were to reflect calmly on this point one would be convinced that the 

sword has not been used recklessly by the Muslims; it has been wielded purely with humane feelings 

in the wider interest of humanity. Utmost regard was always shown to human life, honour and pro-

perty even on the battlefield. That is why in all the eighty-two encounters between the Muslims and 

the non-Muslims during the life of the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), only 1018 persons 

lost their lives on both sides. Out of this 259 were Muslims, whereas the remaining 759 belonged to 

the opposite camp. One wonders at the audacity of these writers only when one compares the reli-

gious wars of Charles the Great, in which 4300 pagan Saxons were killed in cold blood, when one 

recalls the" famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Albigensian war, quieted the scruples of 

a too conscientious general, 'Kill all, God will know His own'.... When we recall the Spanish Inquisiti-

on, the conquest of Mexico and Peru, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the sack of Magdeburg 

by Tilly." 

It is indeed strange that the criticism on the use of sword by Muslims emanates from those whose 

hands are soiled in the blood of countless innocent human beings, by those who exult in the techni-

ques of homicide, who have depersonalised warfare to such an extent that millions of innocent men 

and women are put to death and numberless are thrown into concentration camps and flogged with 

steel rods  and ox-hide whips, and all this is done without any qualm of conscience. As human 

beings. we hang our heads down in shame when we think of the horrifying atrocities which have 

been perpetrated by the modern civilised men. It is estimated that. in the First World War, ten milli-

on soldiers were killed and an equal number of civilians lost their lives, and twenty million died on 

account of widespread epidemics and famines throughout the world as an aftermath of this war. 

Economic costs are estimated at $ 338,000,000,000 of which $ 186,000,000,000 were direct costs. 

The losses in the Second World War were staggeringly greater as compared to those in the first 

one. Twenty-two million persons were killed and thirty-four million were wounded. The estimated 

1069 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

cost of the war was $ 1, 348. 000,000,000 of which $ 1, 167,000,000,000 consisted of direct milita-

ry costs. 

It is significant that in the Korean War, the first instance in which an international organisation 

for establishing peace utilised military force to suppress aggression, more than one million persons 

were killed which added to the civilian deaths in Korea and totalled about five millions. 

Chapter 1: Regarding permission to make a raid, wi-

thout an ultimatum, upon the disbelievers who

Book 019, Number 4292: 

Ibn 'Aun reported: I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the 

disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before m". ing them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me 

that it was necessary in the early days of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at 

the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairi-

ya bint al-Harith. Nafi' said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) 

was among the raiding troops.

the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy

war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do 

not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses 

of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing 

them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist 

from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and 

inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If 

they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be sub-

jected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils 

of war or Fai' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they re-

fuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold 

off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them. When you lay siege to a 

fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not ac-

cord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and 

the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your compa-

nions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated 

When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah's Com-

mand, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) com-

mand, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah's behest with regard to 

them.

One of the Prophets made a holy war. He said to his followers: One who has married a woman and 

wants to consummate to his marriage but has not yet done so; another who has built a house but has 

not yet erected its roof; and another who has bought goats and pregnantshe-camels and is waiting 

for their offspring-will not accommpany me. So he marched on and approached a village at or about 

the time of the Asr prayers. He said to the sun: Thou art subserviant (to Allah) and so am I. O Allah, 

stop it for me a little. It was stopped for him until Allah granted him victory. The people gathered the 

spoils of war (at one place). A fire approached the spoils to devour them, but it did not devour them. 

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Some of you have been guilty of misappropriation. So one man from each 

tribe should swear fealty to me. The did so (putting their hands into his). The hand of one man stuck 

to his hand and the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Your tribe is guilty of misappropriation. 

Let all the members of your tribe swear fealty to me one by one. They did so, when the hands of two 

or three persons got stuck with his hand. He said: You have misappropriated. So they took out gold 

equal in volume to the head of a cow. They-placed it among the spoils on the earth. Then the fire ap-

proached the spoils and devoured them. The spoils of war were not made lawful for any people be-

fore us, This is because Allah saw our weakness and humility and made them lawful for us.

A hadith has been narrated by Mus'ab b. Sa'd who heard it from his father as saying: My father 

took a sword from Khums and brought it to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: 

Grant it to me. He refused. At this Allah revealed (the Qur'anic verse):" They ask thee concerning the 

spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war are for Allah and the Apostle" (viii. 1).

stow it upon me. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Place it there. Then he (my fa-

you got it. (At this) he (my father) said again: Messenger of Allah, bestow it upon me Shall I be trea-

ned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned 

towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. 

Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined 'Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has

returned. (The battle ended in a victory for the Muslims) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

bring evidence to prove it will get his belongings. So I stood up and said: Who will give evidence for 

me? Then I sat down. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said like this. I stood up (again) and said: Who will 

bear witness for me? He (the Holy Prophet) made the same observation the third time, and I stood up 

(once again). Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you, 

O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told 

the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade 

him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will 

not happen. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will not like to deprive one of the li-

ons from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee 

his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has 

told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the ar-

mour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the 

street of Banu Salama. This was the first property I acquired after embracing Islam.

In a version of the hadith narrated by Laith, the words uttered by Abu Bakr are:" No, never! He will

them made a sign to me and. said: Uncle, do you recognise Abu Jahl? 1 said: Yes. What do you want 

to do with him, O my nephew? He said: I have been told that he abuses the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him). By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, if I see him (I will grapple with him) and 

will not leave him until one of us who is destined to die earlier is killed. The narrator said: I wonde-

red at this. Then the other made a sign to me and said similar words. Soon after I saw Abu Jahl. He 

was moving about among men. I said to the two boys: Don't you see? He is the man you were inqui-

ring about. (As soon as they heard this), they dashed towards him, struck him with their swords until 

he was killed. Then they returned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and informed 

him (to this effect). He asked: Which of you has killed him? Each one of them said: I have killed him. 

He said: Have you wiped your swords? They said: No. He examined their swords and said: Both of 

you have killed him. He then decided that the belongings of Abu Jahl he handed over to Mu'adh b.

The latter asked Khalid: What prevented you from giving the booty to him? Khalid said: I thought it 

was too much. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Hand it over to him. Now when Khalid by Auf, the latter 

pulled him by his cloak and said (by way of chafing him): Hasn't the same thing happened what I re-

ported to you from the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him)? When the Messenger of Allah

Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), a man came riding a red camel. He made it kneel 

down, extracted a strip of leather from its girth and tethered the camel with it. Then he began to take 

food with the people and look (curiously around). We were in a poor condition as some of us were 

on foot (being without any riding animals). All of a sudden, he left us hurriedy, came to his camel, 

untethered it, made it kneel down, mounted it and urged the beast which ran off with him. A man on 

a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. 

I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haun-

ches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it 

kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of 

the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man's baggage and weapons.

Abu Bakr ordered us to attack. We made a halt during the last part of the night tor rest and then we 

attacked from all sides and reached their watering-place where a battle was fought. Some of the 

enemies were killed and some were taken prisoners. I saw a group of persons that consisted of wo-

men and children. I was afraid lest they should reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow 

between them and the mountain. When they saw the arrow, they stopped. So I brought them, driving 

them along. Among them was a woman from Banu Fazara. She was wearing a leather coat. With her 

was her daughter who was one of the prettiest girls in Arabia. I drove them along until I brought 

them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet 

disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) met me in the street and said: 

Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me. I had not yet disrobed 

her. When on the next day. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ag;tin met me in the 

street, he said: O Salama, give me that girl, may God bless your father. I said: She is for you. Messen-

were the ones which Allah bestowed upon His Apostle for which no expedition was undertaken eit-

ace be upon him). He would meet the annual expenditure of his family from the income thereof, and

Book 019, Number 4348: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri.

Book 019, Number 4349: 

It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik b. Aus who said: Umar b. 

al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sit-

ting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your 

tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it 

and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: 

Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa' came in 

and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. 'Auf, Zubair 

and Sa'd (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they 

entered. Then he (Yarfa') came again and said: What do you say about 'Ali and Abbas (who are pre-

sent at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, 

decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were 

present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. 

Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by 'Ali 

and Abbas). 'Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and 

the earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:" 

We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"? They said: 

Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and 'Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the hea-

vens and earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"? They (too) said: 

Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur'anic 

verse:" What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is 

for Allah and His Messenger". The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous 

1083 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distrbuted among 

you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and ne-

ver appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was 

left over.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would meet from its income his annual expen-

diture, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I 

adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? 

They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and 'All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do 

you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

passed away, Abu Bakr said:" I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)." 

Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). 

(Referring to Hadrat 'Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, 

and he (referring to 'Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. 

Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had 

said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity." So both of you 

thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, vir-

tuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the 

successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with 

him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, 

virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as 

well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the 

property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both 

of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn't it like 

this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjud-

ge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the 

Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.

Book 019, Number 4350: 

The same hadith has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with a slight variation in 

wording: 'Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and said: Some families from your tribe have come to me 

(then follows the foregoing hadith) by Malik with the difference that the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) would spend on his family for a year. And sometimes Ma'mar said: He would re-

tain sustenance for his family for a year, and what was left of that he spent in the cause of Allah, the 

Majestic and Exalted.

upon him): "We (prophets) do not have any heirs; 

what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity" 

Book 019, Number 4351: 

It is narrated on the authority of 'A'isha who said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) passed away, his wives made up their minds to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan (as their spokes-

man) to Abu Bakr to demand from him their share from the legacy of the Holy Prophet (may peace

said:" We (Prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"?

Book 019, Number 4352: 

It is narrated on the authority of Urwa b. Zubair who narrated from A'isha that she informed him 

that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), sent someone to Abu Bakr 

to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of 

the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said:" We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) cha-

rity." The household of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will live on the income from 

these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over any-

thing from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not 

talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. 'Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did 

not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the li-

fetime of Fatima, 'All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrange-

ment in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his 

allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a 

person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the pre-

sence of Umar). 'Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What 

will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. 'All recited Tashah-

hud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excel-

lence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which 

Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without 

consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until 

the latter's eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my 

life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is dearer to me than the kinship 

of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, 

I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. So 'Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) 

for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the 

pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of 'Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and 

the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God's forgiveness. 

Then 'Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his acti-

on was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high posi-

tion which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have 

a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and 

this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (ex-

planation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably incli-

ned to 'Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.

Book 019, Number 4353: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha that Fatima and 'Abbas approached Abu Bakr, soli-

citing transfer of the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) to them. At that 

time, they were demanding his (Holy Prophet's) lands at Fadak and his share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr 

said to them: I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Then he quoted 

the hadith having nearly the same meaning as the one which has been narrated by Uqail on the aut-

hority of al-Zuhri (and which his gone before) except that in his version he said: Then 'Ali stood up, 

extolled the merits of Abu Bakr mentioned his superiority, and his earlier acceptance of Islam. Then 

he walked to Abu Bakr and swore allegiance to him. (At this) people turned towards 'Ali and said: 

you have done the right thing. And they became favourably inclined to 'Ali after he had adopted the 

proper course of action.

Book 019, Number 4354: 

It has been narrated by 'Urwa b Zubair on the authority of 'A'isha, wife of the Holy Prophet (may 

peace be upon him), that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), re-

quested Abu Bakr, after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), that he should 

set apart her share from what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had left from the 

properties that God had bestowed upon him. Abu Bakr said to her: The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be npon him) said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity)." The 

narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

lah (may peace be upon him) from Khaibar, Fadak and his charitable endowments at Medina. Abu 

Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in 

any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were 

concerned, 'Umar handed them over to 'All and Abbas, but 'Ali got the better of him (and kept the 

property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned 'Umar 

kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that de-

volved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands 

of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as 

such up to this day.

Book 019, Number 4355: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: My heirs cannot share even a dinar (from my legacy) ; what I leave behind after pa-

ving mtintenance allowance to my wives and remuneration to my manager is (to go in) charity.

Chapter 18: The help with angels in Badr and the per-

Book 019, Number 4360: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Umar b. al-Khattab who said: When it was the day on 

which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance 

at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and ni-

neteen. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) turned (his face) towards the Qibla Then he 

stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord:" O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou 

hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small 

band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth." He continued his suppli-

cation to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his 

shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he em-

braced him from behind and said:. Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice 

you, and He will fulfil for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revea-

led   (the   Qur'anic   verse):"   When   ye   appealed   to   your   Lord   for   help,   He   responded   to   your   call 

(saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession." So Allah helped him with 

angels.

Abu Zumail said that the badith was narrated to him by Ibn 'Abbas who said: While on that day a 

Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him' the swishing of 

the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizi'm! He glanced at the polytheist who had 

(now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on 

his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its 

poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related this (event) 

to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that 

day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is 

your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should re-

lease them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infi-

dels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) said: What is your opinion. Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah. I do not hold the 

same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may

cut off their heads. Hand over 'Aqil to 'Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such 

relative to me that I may but off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among 

them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did 

not approve what I said The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why 

are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep ate, if not, I will at 

least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I 

weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was 

shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He poin-

ted to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse:" It is not befitting for a prophet that he 

should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed..." to the end of the verse:" 

so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them."

confinment and justification for setting them free 

without any ransom 

Book 019, Number 4361: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) sent some horsemen to Najd. They captured a man. He was from the tribe of Banu 

Hanifa and was called Thumama b. Uthal. He was the chief of the people of Yamama. People bound 

him with one of the pillars of the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came 

out to (see) him. He said: O Thumama, what do you think? He replied: Muhammad, I have good opi-

nion of you. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will 

do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to 

him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If 

you do a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who 

has spilt blood. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) left him until the next day when he (came to him again) and said: 

What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do me a favour, 

you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If 

you want wealth ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then 

he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I 

testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no

your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful 

to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen 

captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on 

'Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: 

No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). By Allah, 

you will not get a single grain of wheat from Yamama until it is permitted by the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him).

stood up and called out to them (saying): O ye assembly of Jews, accept Islam (and) you will be safe. 

They said: Abu'l-Qasim, you have communicated (God's Message to us). The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) said: I want this (i. e. you should admit that God's Message has been com-

municated to you), accept Islam and you would be safe. They said: Abu'l-Qisim, you have communi-

cated (Allah's Message). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I want this... - He 

said to them (the same words) the third time (and on getting the same reply) he added: You should 

know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I wish that I should expel you from this 

land Those of you who have any property with them should sell it, otherwise they should know that 

the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (and they may have to go away leaving everything be-

ty. They embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned out all the Jews of

(may peace be upon him) sent for Sa'd who came to him riding a donkey. When he approached the 

mosque, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to the Ansar: Stand up to receive your 

chieftain. Then he said (to Sa'd): These people have surrendered accepting your decision. He (Sa'd) 

said: You will kill their fighters and capture their women and children. (Hearing this), the Propbot 

(may peace he tpon him) said: You have adjudged by the command of God. The narrator is reported 

to have said: Perhaps he said: You have adjuged by the decision of a king.

Ibn Muthanna (in his version of the tradition) has not mentioned the alternative words.

Book 019, Number 4370: 

It has been narrated on the authority of A'isha who said: Sa'd was wounded on the day of the Battle 

of the Ditch. A man from the Quraish called Ibn al-Ariqah shot at him an arrow which pierced the 

artery in the middle of his forearm. The Messenger of Allah (may peacce be upon him) pitched a tent 

for him in the mosque and would inquire after him being in close proximity. When he returned 

from the Ditch and laid down his arms and took a bath, the angel Gabriel appeared to him and he 

was removing dust from his hair (as if he had just returned from the battle). The latter said: You have 

laid down arms. By God, we haven't (yet) laid them down. So march against them. The Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) asked: Where? He poirftad to Banu Quraiza. So the Messenger of Al-

lah (may peace he upon him) fought against them. They surrendered at the command of the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but he referred the decision about them to Sa'd who said: I 

decide about them that those of them who can fight be killed, their women and children taken priso-

ners and their properties distributed (among the Muslims).

Book 019, Number 4371: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Hisham (who learnt it from his father) that the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to Sa'd): You have adjudged their case with the judgment of 

God. the Exalted and Glorified.

Book 019, Number 4372: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha that Sa'd's wound became dry and was going to 

heal when he prayed: O God, surely Thou knowest that nothing is dearer to me than that I should 

fight for Thy cause against the people who disbeliever Your Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

and turned him out (from his native place). If anything yet remains to be decided from the war 

against the Quraish, spare my life so that I may fight against them in Thy cause. O Lord, I think Thou 

hast ended the war between us and them. If Thou hast done so, open my wound (so that it may 

discharge) and cause my death thereby. So the wound begin to bleed from the front part of his neck. 

The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the mosque along 

with Sa'd's tent was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming 

to us from you? Lo! it was Sa'd's wound that was bleeding and he died thereof.

that the time for prayer would expire, said their prayers before reaching the street of Banu Quraiza.

Muhajirs when the latter grew rich as a rebult of 

the conquests 

Book 019, Number 4375: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said: When the Muhajirs migrated 

from Mecca to Medina; they came (in a state that) they had not anything (i. e. money) in theirhands, 

while the Ansar possessed lands and date palms. They divided their properties with the Muhajirs. 

The Ansar divided and gave them on the condition that they would give half the fruit from the or-

chards every year, and the Muhajirs would recompense them by working with them and putting in 

labour. The mother of Anas b. Malik was called Umm Sulaim and she was also the mother of 'Abdul-

lah b. Talha who was a brother of Anas from his mother's side. The mother of Anas had given the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) her date-palms. He bestowed them upon Umm Aiman, 

the slave-girl who had been freed by him and was the mother of Usama b. Zaid. When the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had finished the war with the people of Khaibar and returned 

to Medina, the Muhajirs returned to the Ansar all the gifts which they had given them out of the 

fruits. (Anas b. Malik said: ) The Messenger of. Allah (may peace be upon him) returned to my mo-

ther her date-palms and gave to Umm Aiman instead of them date-palms from his orchard. Ibn Shi-

hab says that Umm Aiman was the mother of Usama b. Zaid who was the slave-girl of 'Abdullah b. 

'Abd-ul-Muttalib and hailed from Abyssinia. When Amina gave birth to the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) after the death of his father, Umm Aiman used to nurse him until he grew up. 

He (later on) freed her and married her to Zaid b. Haritha. She died five months after the death of 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

Book 019, Number 4376: 

It has been narrated by Anas that (after his migration to Medina) a person placed at the Prophet's

connection) my people told me to approach the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and 

ask from him what his people had given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman. So I came to the Prophet (may pe-

ace be upon him) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman (also) came (at this time). She put the 

cloth round my neck and said: No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has granted to me. The 

Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Umm Aiman, let him have them and for you are such 

and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is no god besides Him. No, never! The Holy Pro-

there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was 

called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore

him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu 

Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he cal-

led his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) 

about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him.

Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed 

to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I 

said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: 

No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He 

asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He 

asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: 

Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He 

asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: 

The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other 

(i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our 

hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I 

said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know 

what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dia-

logue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation 

(Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about 

his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are 

the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked 

you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had 

been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral 

kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you 

said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether 

you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you 

did not.

So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would 

never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his 

religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is 

like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his follo-

wers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches 

its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had 

been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering 

loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before 

the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he 

did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether 

anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone 

had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what 

1096 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to 

offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you 

have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think 

that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet 

him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion 

would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Mes-

senger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:" In the name of Allah, 

Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor 

of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation 

to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the re-

ward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects." O People of the Book, come to 

the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not as-

and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming 

out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to

the authority of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued 

me with (the spirit of) Islam.

Chapter 27: The battle of Hunain 

Book 019, Number 4385: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abbas who said: I was in the company of the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hunain. I and Abd Sufyan b. Harith b. 'Abd al-Mut-

talib stuck to the Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we did not separate from him. 

And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been 

presented to him by Farwa b. Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the 

disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) be-

gan to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the 

stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who said: Abbas, call out to 

the people of al-Samura. Abbas (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: 

Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came 

back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! 'Abbas said: 

They began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call to The Ansar. Those (who called out to them) 

shouted: O ye party of the Ansar! O party of the Ansar! Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj were the last to 

be called. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O Banu Al-Harith b. al-Khazraj! O BanU Harith b. 

al-Khazraj! And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his mule loo-

ked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said: This is the time when the fight is ra-

ging hot. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took (some) pebbles and threw them 

in the face of the infidels. Then he said: By the Lord of Muhammad, the infidels are defeated. 'Abbas 

said: I went round and saw that the battle was in the same condition in which I had seen it. By Allah,

it remained in the same condition until he threw the pebbles. I continued to watch until I found that 

their force had been spent out and they began to retreat.

Book 019, Number 4386: 

A version of the tradition has been transmitted through another chain of narrators. In this version 

the words uttered by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) (after he had thrown the pebbles in 

the face of the enemy) are reported as:" By the Lord of the Ka'ba, they have been defeated." And there 

is at the end the addition of the words:" Until Allah defeated them" (and I imagine) as if I saw the 

Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) chasing them on his mule.

Book 019, Number 4387: 

'Abbas reported: I was with Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hunain. The 

rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that the hadith transmitted by Yonus and Ma'-

mar is more detailed and complete.

Book 019, Number 4388: 

It has been narratedon the authority of Abu Ishaq who said: A man asked Bara' (b. 'Azib): Did you 

run away on the Day of Hunain. O, Abu Umira? He said: No, by Allah, The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) did not turn his back; (what actually happened was that) some young men from 

among his companions, who were hasty and who were either without any arms or did not have ab-

undant arms, advanced and met a party of archers (who were so good shots) that their arrows never 

missed the mark. This party (of archers) belonged to Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir. They shot at the 

advancing young men and their arrows were not likely to miss their targets. So these young men 

turned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was riding on his white mule 

and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib was leading him. (At this) he got down from his 

mule, invoked God's help, and called out: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of 'Abd 

al-Muttalib. Then he deplnved his men into battle array.

Book 019, Number 4389: 

It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) by Abu Ishiq that a person said to 

Bara' (b. 'Azib): Abu Umara, did you flee on the Day of Hunain? He replied: The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) did not retreat. (What actually happened was that some hasty young men 

who were either inadequately armed or were unarmed met a group of men from Banu Hawazin and 

Banu Nadir who happened to be (excellent) archers. The latter shot at them a volley of arrows that 

did not miss. The people turned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Abu Sufyan b. 

Harith was leading his mule. So he got down, prayed and invoked God's help. He said: I am the Pro-

phet. This is no untruth. I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib. O God, descend Thy help. Bara' continued:

When the battle grew fierce. we, by God. would seek protection by his side, and the bravest among 

us was he who confronted the onslaught and it was the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).

Book 019, Number 4390: 

It has been narrated through a still different chain of transmitters by the same narrator (i. e. Abu 

Ishaq) who said: I heard from Bara' who was asked by a man from the Qais tribe: Did you run away 

from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hunain? Bara' said: But the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not run away. On that day Banu Hawzzin took part 

in the battle as archers (on the side of the disbelievers). When we attacked them, they retreated and 

we fell upon the booty; (they rallied) and advanced towards us with arrows. (At that time) I saw the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith 

was holding its bridle. He (the Messenger of Allah was saying: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I 

am a descendant of 'Abd al-Muttalib.

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Bara' with another chain of transmitters, but this

Book 019, Number 4392: 

This tradition has been narrated on the authority of Salama who said: We fought by the side of the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) at Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, I advan-

ced and ascended a hillock. A man from the enemy side turned towards me and I shot him with an 

arrow. He (ducked and) hid himself from me. I could not understand what he did, but (all of a sud-

den) I saw that a group of people appeared from the other hillock. They and the Companions of the 

Prophet (may peace be upon him) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back 

and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (co-

vering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders. My waist-

wrapper got loose and I held the two mantles together. (In this downcast condition) I passed by the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his white mule. He said: The son of 

Akwa' finds himself to be utterly perplexed. Wher. the Companions gathered round him from all si-

des. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got down from his mule. picked up a handful 

of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 

There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So 

they turned back fleeing. and Allah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them, and the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed their booty among the Muslims.

return. His Companions said: Shall we depart without having conquered it? The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) said: (All right) make a raid in the morning. They did so. and were woun-

ded (with the arrows showered upon them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that when (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan 

(at the head of a force) reached him. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) held consulta-

tions with his Companions. The narrator said: Abu Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he 

(the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke 'Umar (expressing his views), but he (the 

Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa'd b. 'Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Al-

lah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses 

into the sea, we would do so. If you order us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-

Ghimad, we would do so. The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-

carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The 

Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him 

about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, 

Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All 

right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about 

Abu Sufyan. He would again say', I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. 'Utba, Shaiba and 

Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By 

Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go 

when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

said: This is the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here 

and here; (and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth.

Chapter 30: The conquest of Mecca 

Book 019, Number 4395: 

It has been narrated by 'Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said: Many deputations came 

to Mu'awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Hu-

raira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and 

invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening 

and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, 

and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a 

tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest 

of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) advanced until he reached 

Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida 

with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: 

Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me ex-

cept the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. 

The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these for-

ward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we 

shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indi-

cated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-

Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was 

killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: 

Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from 

this day on.

Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the 

Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations 

have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet 

(may peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and 

when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here 

we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and ten-

derness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am 

a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you 

and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Al-

lah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your 

assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufy-

an and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded until 

he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka'ba. He reached near an 

idol by the side of the Ka'ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near 

the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been 

established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to 

Safa', ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka'ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and be-

gan to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.

The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions: 

(i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in 

your way).... (ii) They (the Ansar) replied: We said so, Messenger of Allah! He said: What is my 

name? I am but Allah's bondman and His Messenger.

Book 019, Number 4396: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Rabah who said: We came to Mu'awiya b. Abu 

Sufyan as a deputation and Abu Huraira was among us. Each of us would prepare food for his com-

panions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn 

today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you 

could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the food 

was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as 

commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu 'Ubaida as comman-

der of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Hu-

raira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly 

of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet 

them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left 

and said: You will meet us at as-Safa'. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day 

was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ascended the mount of as-Safa'. 

The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger 

ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who 

lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the 

man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspirati-

on descended upon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: You were saying that 

the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what 

my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I

Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He 

said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.

beginning nor can It restore to life

It has been narrated on the authority of al-Bara' b. 'Azib who said: 'Ali b. Abu Talib penned the 

treaty between the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and the polytheists on the Day of Hudai-

biya. He wrote: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled. They (the polytheists) 

said: Do not write words" the Messenger of Allah". If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, 

we would not fight against you. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to 'Ali: Strike out these 

words. He (Ali) said: I am not going to strike them out. So the Prophet (may peace be upon him) 

struck them out with his own hand. The narrator said that the conditions upon which the two sides 

had agreed included that the Muslims would enter Mecca (next year) and would stay there for three 

days, and that they would not enter bearing arms except in their sheaths or bolsters.

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who heard Bars' b. Azib say: When the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made peace with the people of Hudaibiya, 'Ali drew up the 

agreement between them, and so he wrote: Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah. (This is followed by 

the same wording as we have in the previous tradition except the omission of the words: This is what 

he has settled.)

Book 019, Number 4403: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Bara' who said: When the Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) was checked from going to the Ka'ba, the people of Mecca made peace with him'on the conditi-

on that he would (be allowed to) enter Mecca (next year) and stay there for three days, that he would 

not enter (the city) except with swords in their sheaths and arms encased in their covers, that he 

would not take eway with him anyone from its dwellers, nor would he prevent anyone from those 

with him to stay on in Mecca (if he so desired). He said to 'Ali: Write down the terms settled between 

us. (So 'Ali wrote): In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful. This is what Muhammad, 

the Messenger of Allah, has settled (with the Meccans), The polytheists said to him: If we knew that 

thou art the Messenger of of Allah, we would follow you. But write: Muhammad b. 'Abdullah. So he 

told 'Ali to strike out these words. 'Ali said: No, by Allah, I will not strike them out. The Messenger of 

Allah (may Peace be upon him) said: Show me their place (on the parchment). So he ('Ali) showed 

him their place and he (the Holy Prophet) struck them out; and 'Ali wrote: Ibn 'Abdullah. (According 

to the terms of the treaty, next year) the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) stayed there for 

three days When it was the third day, they said to 'Ali: This is the last day according to the terms of 

your companion. So tell him to leave. 'Ali informed the Prophet (may peace be upon him) accordin-

gly. He said: Yes, and left (the city). Ibn Janab in his version of the tradition used:" we would swear 

allegiance to you" instead of" we would follow you".

Book 019, Number 4404: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Quraish made peace with the Prophet (may 

peace be upon him). Among them was Suhail b. Amr. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to 

'Ali: Write" In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful." Suhail said: As for" Bismillah," 

we do not know what is meant by" Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim" (In the name of Allah most Gra-

cious and most Merciful). But write what we understand, i. e. Bi ismika allahumma (in thy name. O 

Allah). Then, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Write:" From Muhammad, the Messenger of 

Allah." They said: If we knew that thou welt the Messenger of Allah, we would follow you. Therefore, 

write your name and the name of your father. So the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: 

Write" From Muhammad b. 'Abdullah." They laid the condition on the Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) that anyone who joined them from the Muslims, the Meccans would not return him, and anyo-

ne who joined you (the Muslims) from them, you would send him back to them. The Companions 

said: Messenger of Allah, should we write this? He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join 

them-may Allah keep him away! and one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back) Allah 

will provide him relief and a way of escape.

Book 019, Number 4405: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Wa'il who said: Sahal b. Hunaif stood up on the Day 

of Siffin and said: O ye people, blame yourselves (for want of discretion) ; we were with the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hudaibiya. If we had thought it fit to fight, we 

could fight. This was in the truce between the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the 

polytheists. Umar b. Khattab came, approached the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and 

said: Messenger of Allah, aren't we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: By all 

means. He asked: Are not those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed. from their side in 

the Fire? He replied: Yes. He said: Then why should we put a blot upon our religion and return, while 

Allah has not decided the issue between them and ourselves? He said: Son of Khattab, I am the Mes-

senger of Allah. Allah will never ruin me. (The narrator said): Umar went away, but he could not 

contain himself with rage. So he approached Abu Bakr and said: 'Abu Bakr, aren't we fighting for 

truth and they for falsehood? He replied: Yes. He asked: Aren't those killed from our side in Paradise 

and those killed from their side in the Fire? He replied: Why not? He (then) said: Why should we 

then disgrace our religion and return while God has not yet decided the issue between them and

ruin him. (The narrator continued): At this (a Sura of) the Qur'an (giving glad tidings of the victory) 

was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He sent for Umar and made him

pleased, and returned.

Book 019, Number 4406: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Shaqiq who said: I heard Sahl b. Hunaif say at Siffin: O ye 

people, find fault with your (own) discretion. By Allah, on the Day of Abu Jandal (i. e. the day of Hu-

daibiya), I thought to myself that, if I could, I would reverse the order of the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) (the terms of the truce being unpalatable). By Allah, we have never hung our 

swords on our shoulders in any situation whatsoever except when they made easy for us to realise 

the goal envisaged by us, but this battle of yours (seems to be an exception). Ibn Numair (in his versi-

on) did not mention the words:" In any situatina whatsoever"

Book 019, Number 4407: 

The same tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of 

A'mash. This version contains the words: Ila amrin yofzi'una instead of Ila amrin na'rifuhu.

Book 019, Number 4408: 

It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of Abu Wa'il who 

said: I heard Sahl b. Hunaif say at Siffin: Blame (the hollowness) of your views about your religion. I 

thought to myself on the day of Abu Jandal that if I could turn down the order of the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him), I would. The situation was so difficult that if we mended it at one 

place, it was rent at another.

Book 019, Number 4409: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said: When they (Companions of the 

Holy Prophet) were overwhelmed with grief and distress on his return from Hudaibiya where he had 

slaughtered his sacrificial beasts (not being allowed to proceed to Mecca), the Qur'anic verse: Inna 

fatahna... laka fathan mobinan to fauzan 'aziman, was revealed to him. (At this) he said: On me has 

descended a verse that is dearer to me than the whole world.

Book 019, Number 4411: 

It has been reported on the authority of Hudbaifa b. al-Yaman who said: Nothing prevented me 

from being present at! he Battle of Badr except this incident. I came out with my father Husail (to 

participate in the Battle), but we were caught by the disbelievers of Quraish. They said: (Do) you in-

tend to go to Muhammad? We said: We do not intend to go to him, but we wish to go (back) to Me-

dina. So they took from us a covenant in the name of God that we would turn back to Medina and 

would not fight on the side of Muhammad (may peace be upon him). So, we came to the Messenger 

of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related the incident to him. He said: Both, of you proceed (to 

Medina) ; we will fulfil the covenant made with them and seek God's help against them.

Chapter 35: The battle of Ahzab or the battle of the 

ditch 

Book 019, Number 4412: 

It has been narrated by Ibrahim al-Taimi on the authority of his father who said: We were sitting 

in the company of Hudhaifa. A man said: If I were in the time of the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him), I would have fought by his side and would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifa 

said: You might have done that, (but you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm). I was with 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the night of the Battle of Abzib and we were 

gripped by a violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) said: Hark, 

the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on 

the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We all kept quiet and none of us responed 

to him. (Again) he said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy 

shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We kept quiet 

and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings 

me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgtuent by Allah (the Glorious 

and Exalted) Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by 

name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and 

do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a 

heated bath untill I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back against fire I put an arrow in 

the middle of the bow. intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him)" Do not provoke them against me." Had I shot at him, I would have hit 

him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting my-

self before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to 

his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers. So I conti-

nued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.

Chapter 36: The battle of Uhud 

Book 019, Number 4413: 

It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that (when the enemy got the upper hand) 

on the day of the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was left with only 

seven men from the ansar and two men from the Quraish. When the enemy advanced towards him 

and overwhelmed him, he said: Whoso turns them away from us will attain Paradise or will be my 

Companion in Paradise. A man from the Ansar came forward and fought (the enemy) until he was 

killed. The enemy advanced and overwhelmed him again and he repeated the words: Whoso turns 

them away, from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Arsar 

came forward and fought until he was killed. This state continued until the seven Ansar were killed 

(one after the other). Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to his two Compa-

nions: We have not done justice to our Companions.

Book 019, Number 4414: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abd-ul-'Aziz b. Abu Hazim, who learnt from his father 

(Abu Hazim). The latter heard it from Sahl b. Sa'd who was asked about the injury which the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got on the day of the Battle of Uhud. He said: The face of 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was injured, his front teeth were damaged and his 

helmet was crushed. Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), was 

washing the blood (from his head), and 'Ali b. Abu Talib was pouring water on it from a shield. 

When Fatima saw that the bleeding had increased on account of (pouring) water (on the wound), 

she took a piece of mat and burnt it until it was reduced to ashes. She put the ashes on the wound 

and the bleeding stopped.

Book 019, Number 4415: 

It has been reported on the authority of Abu Hazim who heard from Sahl b. Sa'd. The latter was 

asked about the injury of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: By God, I know 

the person who washed the wound of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who poured 

water on it and with what the wound was treated. Then Sahl narrated the same tradition as has been

was wiping the blood (from his face) and was saying: How will these people attain salvation who 

have wounded their Prophet and broken his tooth while he called them towards God? At this time, 

God, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the Verse:" Thou hast no authority" (iii. 127).

Book 019, Number 4418:

Abu Huraira from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (With this introduction) he

him) said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a people who have done this to the Messenger of Allah 

1110 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

(may peace be upon him), and he was at that time pointing to his front teeth. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) also said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a person who has been killed by 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the way of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.

Chapter 38: The persecution of the holy prophet (may 

peace be upon him) at the hands of the infidels and 

hypocrites 

Book 019, Number 4421: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas'ud who said: While the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) was saying his prayer near the Ka'ba and Abu Jahl with his companions was sit-

ting (near by), Abu Jahl said, referring to the she-camel that had been slaughtered the previous day: 

Who will rise to fetch the foetus of the she-camel of so and so, and place it between the shoulders of 

Muhammad when he goes down in prostration (a posture in prayer). The one most accursed among 

the people got up, brought the foetus and, when the Prophet (may peace be upon him) went down in 

prostration, placed it between his shoulders. Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned 

upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away 

from the back of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and 

informed (his daughter) Fatima, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident). She 

came and removed (the filthy thing) from him. Then she turned towards them rebuking them (the 

mischief-mongers). When the Prophet (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he invoked 

God's imprecations upon them in a loud voice. When he prayed, he prayed thrice, and when he as-

ked for God's blessings, he asked thrice. Then he said thrice: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the 

Quraish. When they heard his voice, laughter vanished from them and they feared his malediction. 

Then he said: O God, it is for Thee to deal with Abu Jahl b. Hisham, 'Utba b. Rabi'a, Shaiba b. Rabi'a. 

Walid b. Uqba, Umayya b. Khalaf, Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait (and he mentioned the name of the seventh 

person. which I did not remember). By One Who sent Muhammad with truth, I saw (all) those he 

had named lying slain on the Day of Badr. Their dead bodies were dragged to be thrown into a pit 

near the battlefield.

Abu Ishiq had said that the name of Walid b. 'Uqba has been wrongly mentioned in this tradition.

Book 019, Number 4422: 

It has been narrated by Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) who said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) was lying postrate in prayer and around him were some people from the Quraish, 

1111 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 19: THE BOOK OF JIHAD AND EXPEDITION (KITAB AL-JIHAD WA'L-SIYAR)

'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait brought the foetus of a she-camel and threw it on the back of the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him). He did not raise his head until Fatima arrived, removed it from his 

back and cured him who had done that (ugly act). He said: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the 

chiefs of the Quraish. Abu Jahl b. Hisham, 'Utba b. Rabi'a. Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait, Shaiba b. Rabi'a, Um-

ayya b. Khalaf or Ubayy b. Khalaf (Shu'ba, one of the narrator of this tradition is in doubt about the 

exact person). I saw that all were slain in the Battle of Badr and their dead bodies were thrown into a 

well, except that of Umayya or Ubayy which was cut into pieces and was thrown into the well.

Book 019, Number 4423: 

Abu Ishiq has narrated a similar tradition through a different chain of transmitters and has added: 

He (the Messenger of Allah) loved to repeat the supplication thrice. He was saying: O Allah, it is for 

Thee to deal with the Quraish (repeating these words thrice). And among the Quraish, he mentioned 

(the names of) al-Walid b. 'Utba and Umayya b. Khalaf. (The narrator says there is no doubt about 

the names of these persons but he has forgotten the name of the seventh man).

Book 019, Number 4424: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah that, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) turned his face towards the Ka'ba and invoked God's imprecations upon six men of the 

Quraish, amorig whom were Abu Jahl. Umayya b. Khalaf, Utba b. Rabi'a, Shaiba b. Rabi'a and 'Uqba 

b. Abu Mu'ait I swear by God that I saw them lying slain in the battlefield of Badr. It being a hot day, 

their complexion had changed (showing signs of decay).

Book 019, Number 4425: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet (may peace be upon him), 

who said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him): Messenger of Allah, has there come 

upon you a day more terrible than the day of Ubud. He said: I have experienced from thy people and 

the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of 'Aqaba. I betook 

myself to Ibn Abd Yalil b. Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond 

to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I rea-

ched Qarn al-Tha'alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow 

on me. I looked and lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said.: God. the Ho-

noured and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy 

call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him 

what thou wishest (him to do) with, regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) cal-

led out to me, greeted me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to 

thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains. and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest 

order me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains that

But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produ-

ce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners 

to Him.

Book 019, Number 4426: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Jundub b. Sufyan who said: A finger of the Messenger of

over the persecution of the hypocrites 

Book 019, Number 4431: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Usama b. Zaid that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) 

rode a donkey. It had on it a saddle under which was a mattress made at Fadak (a place near Medi-

na). Behind him he seated Usama. He was going to the street of Banu Harith al-Khazraj to inquire af-

ter the health of Sa'd b. Ubada This happened before the Battle of Badr. (He proceeded) until he pas-

sed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the 

Jews and among them were 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by 

the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, 'Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his 

mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Holy Prophet (may 

peace be upon him) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and re-

cited to them the Qur'an. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing 

for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to 

you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love 

(to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke 

one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa'd b. 

'Ubida. He said: Sa'd, haven't you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He 

has said so and so. Sa'd said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime 

position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their 

king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by 

the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the 

behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Holy Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.

A similar tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters by Ibn Shihab with 

the addition of the words:" Before Abdullah (b. Ubayy) became a Muslim."

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that it was said to the Holy Prophet (may

party of) Muslims also went (with him). On the way they had to walk over a piece of land affected 

with salinity. When the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approached him, he said: Do not 

come near me. By Allah, the obnoxious smell of your donkey has offended me. (As a rejoinder to this 

remark), a man from the Ansar said: By God, the smell of the donkey of the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him) is better than your smell. (At this), a man from the tribe of 'Abdullah got furious. 

Then people from both sides got furious and exchanged blows with sticks, hands and shoes. (The 

narrator says) that (after this scuffle) we learnt that (the Qur'anic verse):" It two parties of the Belie-

vers have a quarrel, make ye peace between them" (xlix. 9) was revealed about these fighting parties.

Jahl? Ibn Mas'ud went (to gather this information). He found that the two sons of 'Afra' had struck 

him and he lay cold at the point of death. He caught him by his beard and said: Art thou Abu Jahl? 

He said: is there anybody superior to the person you have killed, or (he said) his people have killed 

him. Ibn Mas'ud says that, according to Abu Mijlaz, Abu Jahl said: Alas! a person other than a farmer 

would have killed me.

great hardship. When be heard this, Ka'b said: By God, you will be put to more trouble by him. Mu-

hammad b. Maslama said: No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsa-

ke him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give me a loan. He said: 

What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You 

are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you? He said: Pledge me your 

children. He said: The son of one of us may abuse us saying that he was pledged for two wasqs of da-

tes, but we can pledge you (cur) weapons. He said: All right. Then Muhammad b. Maslama promised 

that he would come to him with Harith, Abu 'Abs b. Jabr and Abbad b. Bishr. So they came and called 

upon him at night. He came down to them. Sufyan says that all the narrators except 'Amr have stated 

that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Mu-

hammad b. Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na'ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it 

to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he 

comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your 

job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense 

from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the wo-

men of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So 

he caught it and smelt. Then he said: Allow me to do so (once again). He then held his head fast and 

said to his companions: Do your job. And they killed him.

Chapter 42: The battle of Khaibar 

Book 019, Number 4437: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon

Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) mounted (his horse). Abu Talha mounted his 

and I mounted behind Abu Talha on the same horse. The Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

rode through the streets of Khaibar and (I rode so close to him) that my knee touched the thigh of the 

Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him). The wrapper got aside from his thigh, and I could see its 

whiteness. When he entered the town, he said: God is Great. Khaibar shall face destruction. When we 

descend in the city-square of a people, it is a bad day for them who have been warned (and have not 

taken heed). He said these words thrice. The people of the town had just come out from (their hou-

ses) to go about their jobs. They said (in surprise): Muhammad has come. We captured Khaibar by 

force.

Book 019, Number 4438:

rise when they had come out with their axes, spades and strings driving their cattle along. They 

shouted (in surprise): Muhammad has come along with his force! The Messenger of Allah (may pe-

people said to (my brother) 'Amir b. al-Akwa': Won't you recite to us some of your verses? Amir was 

a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting:

O God, if Thou hadst not guided us

We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity,

Nor offered prayers.

We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses,

And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies).

Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity.

Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They 

said: It is 'Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. 

Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator 

says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger 

afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behold, God has conquered 

it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many 

fires. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What are these fires? And what are they 

cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic as-

ses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or 

should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew 

themselves up in battle array 'Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew 

before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and

'Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) 

had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I 

was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What's the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mo-

ther be thy ransom, people presume that 'Amir's sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said 

that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him 

(for 'Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He 

was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can 

fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.

Book 019, Number 4441: 

It has been reported on the authority of Salama b. Akwa' who said: On the day of the Battle of 

Khaibar my brother fought a fierce fight by the side of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him). His sword rebounded and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a 

man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit 

me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) per-

mitted him. 'Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited:

By God, if God had guided us not,

We would hive neither been guided aright nor practised charity,

Nor offered prayers.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What you have said is true, 'I (continued):

And descend on us peace and tranquillity

And keep us steadfast if we encounter (with our enemies)

And the polytheists have rebelled against us.

When I finished my rajaz, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who composed 

these verses? I said: They were composed by my brother. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) said: May God show mercy to him! I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God's 

mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He died as God's devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has 

said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b. Akwa') about (the death of 'Amir). He related to me a simi-

lar tradition except that he said: When I said some people were reluctant invoke God's blessings on 

him, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him said: They lied. ('Amir) died as God's devotee 

and warrior (in the cause of Allah). For him there is a double reward, and he pointed out this by put-

ting his two fingers together.

We would have neither been guided aright nor practised charity,

Descend on us peace and tranquillity.

Behold I these people (the Meccans) refused to follow us.

According to another version, he recited:

The chieftains (of the tribes) refused to follow us

When they contemplated mischief, we rejected it.

And with this (verse) he would raise his voice.

Book 019, Number 4449: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Abu 'Ubaid who said that he heard Salama b. al-

Akwa' say: I went out before the Adhan for the morning prayer had been delivered. The milch she-

camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) were grazing at Dhu Qarad. 'Abd al-

Rahman b. Auf's slave met me and said: The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) had been taken away. I said: Who has taken them away? He said: (the people belon-

ging to the tribe of) Ghatafan. I cried thrice: Help! I made the whole city between the two lavas hear 

my cry. Then I ran straight in their pursuit until I overtook them at Dhu Qarad where they were just 

going to water their animals. I, being an archer, began to shoot them with my arrows and was say-

ing: I am the son of al-Akwa'. And today is the day when the cowards will meet their doom. I conti-

nued to chant until I rescued the milch she-camels from them, and snatched from them thirty mant-

les. Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some other people came along. I said: 

Prophet of Allah, I have prevented them from water while they were thirsty. So you should send a 

force (to punish them). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ibn al-Akwa', you have taken (what, you have ta-

ken). Now let them go. Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made 

me mount behind him on his she-camel until we entered Medina.

Book 019, Number 4450: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who 

said: We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we were 

fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the 

small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat on 

the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and wa-

tered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called us to take the 

vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then 

other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the 

vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) 

again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He 

gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the 

last batch of them. He said (to me): Won't you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I 

took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the 

people. He said: (Doesn't matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then 

he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle 

'Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O

God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to 

the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to 

that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded.

I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha 

(doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emi-

grant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of 

Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, 

I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of 

the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (may 

peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons 

(to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower 

part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword 

and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my 

hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise 

his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (may peace 

be upon him). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from" Abalat called Mi-

kraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy poly-

theists. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go 

(so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against 

them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion. God re-

vealed the Qur'anic verse:" It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them 

in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them" (xlviii. 24). Then we moved re-

turning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan 

who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked God's forgiveness for 

one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we re-

ached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Ra-

bah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels.

When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: 

Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. 'Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and 

turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the rai-

ders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre:

I am the son of al-Akwa'

And today is the day of defeat for the mean.

I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, 

would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse

By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman tur-

ned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him 

and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain 

and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all 

the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with 

them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more 

than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a 

mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and 

his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until 

They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat 

down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow 

I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has 

been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of 

you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain 

coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? 

They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa'. By the Being Who has honoured 

the countenance of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you 

will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from 

my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who came 

riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi.

Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I 

caught hold of the rein of Akhram's horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): 

Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his 

Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you 

kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyr-

dom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd 

al-Rahman's horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned 

about riding Akhram's horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him), met 'Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being 

Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running 

on my feet (so fast) that I couldn't see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (may peace be 

upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a 

valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, 

for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before 

they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), 

overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I

am the son of al-Akwa'; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow 

(who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa' who has been chasing 

us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa'. They left two horses dead tired on 

the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I 

met 'Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having 

water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Al-

lah (may peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them 

away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything 

else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had 

slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and 

hump for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select 

from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that 

nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in 

the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who 

has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. 

(At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. 

When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa' and 

his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing.

When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman 

today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-

the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them 

for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-

Adba'. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is 

there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He conti-

nued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don't you show consideration to a dignified person 

and don't you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (may pe-

ace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get 

down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I 

am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or 

two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or 

two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his 

shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead 

of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messen-

ger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following 

rajaz verses for the people:

By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,

We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.

(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;

Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,

And descend tranquillity upon us.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this? 'Amir said: it is 'Amir. He said: 

May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab 

who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from 

Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing 

his sword and chanting:

Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)

A fully armed, and well-tried warrior.

When the war comes spreading its flames.

My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:

Khaibar certainly knows that I am 'Amir,

A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.

They exchanged blows. Marbab's sword struck the shield of 'Amir who bent forward to attack his 

opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm 

which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of 

the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir's deed has gone waste; he has killed him-

self. So I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. 

Amir's deed has gone waste. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? 

I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for 'Amir 

there is a double reward. Then he sent me to 'Ali who had tore eyes, and said: I will give the banner 

to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to 

'Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah 

(may peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and 'Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). 

The latter advanced chanting:

Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab,

A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero)

When war comes spreading its flames.

'Ali chanted in reply:

who comes near me. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to smile (at these 

words). She said: Messenger of Allah, kill all those people-other than us-whom thou hast declared to

day. When a man would pass by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Spare them for

ple, Abd Talba would say: Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be thy ransom, do not rai-

se your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck. The

ments, so I could me the anklets on their feet. They were carrying water-skins on their backs and

Chapter 47: Women participants in jihad to be given a

Book 019, Number 4456: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz that Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas inquiring 

of him five things. Ibn Abbas said: If I had not the fear of committing (sin) for concealing the know-

ledge I would not have written to him. Najda wrote to him saying (after praising the Almighty and 

invoking blessings on the Prophet): Tell me whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) took women to participate with him in Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular 

share from the booty; whether he killed the children of (the enemy in the war how long an orphan 

would be entitled to consideration as such and for whom the Kbums (fifth part of the booty) was 

booty. Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (may

peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and 

sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from 

the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them. And the of Allah (may peace be upon 

him) did not kill the children of the enemy, so thou shouldst not kill the children. Also you have 

written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man 

has become bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others as well u meeting his obliga-

tion towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated you such), but when he can look after his inte-

rests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have written to me inquiring about 

Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) 

used to say: It is for us, but those people (i. e. Banu Umayya) have denied it to us.

Book 019, Number 4457: 

This tradition has been narrated by the game authority (Yazid b. Hurmus) through a different 

chain of transmitters with the following difference in the elucidation of one of the points raised by 

Najda in his letter to Ibn Abas: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill the 

children, so thou shouldst not kill them unless you could know what Khadir had known about the 

child he killed, or you could distinguish between a child who would grow up to he a believer (and a 

child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that you killed the (prospective) non-believer 

and left the (prospective) believer aside.

Book 019, Number 4458: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said: Najda b. 'Amir al-Haruri wro-

te to Ibn Abbas asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether they would get a share 

from the booty (it they participated in Jihad) ; about the killing of (enemy) children (in war) ; about 

the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to 

who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have 

written to him.) Write: You have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would 

get a share of the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the 

sort for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about the killing 

of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of Allah (may peare be 

upon him) did not kill them. and thou shouldst not kill them unless thou knew what the companion 

of Moses (i. e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed. And you have written asking me about the 

orphan as to when the period of his orphanhood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of" orphan" is 

dropped from him. (In this regard, you should know that) the sobriquet" orphan" will not be dropped 

from him until he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the clo-

se relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people have de-

nied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).

Holy Prophet) (from the booty) whom God has mentioned. (I have to tell you that) we thought we 

were the close relatives of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but our people have re-

fused to recognise us as such. You have asked about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to 

an end. (I have to say that) when he reaches the age of marriage, attains maturity of mind, and his 

property is returned to him, then he is no longer an orphan. You have inquired whether the Messen-

Introduction 

Islam is a social religion, not in the sense that it is through society alone that religion breathes its 

sacred spirit in the individuals, but in the sense that it aims at inculcating God-consciousness both in 

individual and society. Jesus said: The Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Islam fully subscribes to this 

view, since no just kingdom can be founded on earth by unjust men, who have not first created the 

Kingdom of Heaven in their hearts, but Islam goes a step forward and says that the creation of the 

Kingdom of Heaven within heart is not enough; this Kingdom of Heaven within must be externalised 

into a Kingdom of Heaven on earth, so that the organised life of man may be built up on the basis of 

love, fraternity and justice. 

It thus becomes clear that the Islamic State is not an end in itself, but a means to an end, the end 

being the development of a community of people who stand up for equity and justice, for right 

against wrong or, to phrase it differently, for the creation of such conditions as would enable the 

greatest possible number of human beings to live spiritually, morally and physically in accordance 

with the teachings of Islam. 

Thus the founding of an Islamic State is not a sort of" worldly activity," something undesirable, as 

some people wrongly suppose, but the sine qua non of social justice, as demanded by Islam." The 

state," says Dr lqbal," from the Islamic standpoint, is an endeavour to transform these ideal principles 

into space-time forces, an aspiration to realize them in a definite human organization. It is in this 

sense alone that state in Islam is a theocracy, not in the sense that it is headed by a representative of 

God on earth who can always screen his despotic will behind his supposed infallibility. 

As this State is meant to enforce the law of the Shari'ah within its territorial jurisdiction, it is duty 

bound to make itself an efficient organ for transforming the high ideals of Islam into reality. The 

Qur'an, while enumerating the main functions of the Islamic State, says:" Those who, if We establish 

them in the land, observe worship, and pay the poor-due and enjoin good and forbid evil" (xxii. 41). 

This shows that the function of an Islamic State is not only to defend its citizens from external at-

tack and internal disorder, but also to enable individual man and woman to realise the tenets of Is-

lam and their beliefs. in the socioeconomic concerts of their practical life. 

So far as the nature of the Islamic State is concerned, it is theocracy with regard to God in the sen-

se that the de jure sovereignty belongs to Allah Whose de facto sovereignty is inherent and manifest 

in the working of the entire universe and Who enjoys exclusively the sovereign prerogative over all 

the creation. The Holy Qur'an has stressed this point in so many verses: 

" The Command is for none but for Allah: He has commanded that ye obey 

none but Him: that is the right path" (xii. 40). 

" Follow the revelation sent unto you from your Lord, and do not follow the (so-called) guardians 

other than Him" (vii. 3). 

1134 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 20: THE BOOK ON GOVERNMENT (KITAB AL-IMARA)

" And those who do not make their decisions in accordance with that revealed by Allah are (in 

fact) the deniers of Truth" (v. 44). It thus becomes quite clear that a State established on the basis of 

God's sovereignty cannot enforce any law in contravention of the Qur'an and the Sunnah even if all 

the citizens make a demand for it. An Islamic State is, therefore, theocratic in one aspect as it is run 

according to God-given laws, but it is altogether a differmt theocracy of which Europe has had the 

bitter experience and in which, a priestly clan is sharply marked off from the rest of the population 

and exercises an unchecked domination and enforces laws of its own making in the name of God, 

and thus imposes its own godhood upon the common people. The priest puts himself as a mediator 

between the masses and the unseen God. Such a system is quite un-Islamic. The theocracy built by 

Islam is not ruled by a particular religious class, but by the whole community of Muslims including 

the rank and file. as Allah has not appointed a particular individual, group, race or class as the re-

presentative of the Real Sovereign upon the earth, but the whole community. The Qur'an says:" Allah 

has promised to those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will assuredly make 

them to succeed (the present) rulers and grant them vicegerency in the land just as He made those 

before them to succeed (others)" (ixiv. 55). This verse makes it clear that all believers have been con-

ferred upon the Caliphate and not a special class or dynasty. Moreover, the Caliphate granted by Al-

lah to the faithful is the popular vicegerency and not a limited one and thus it is run with the con-

sent of the people. The concepts of the Divine Right of Kingship and the infallibility of clergy are ali-

en to the spirit of Islam. Every Muslim stands on equal level with the other Muslim as the vicegerent 

of the Lord upon the earth. None of them, therefore, enjoys any preference to the other by virtue of 

high birth or belonging to a special religious group. History is teplete with instances of Caliphs being 

brought to the court and publicly criticised by ordinary men and women. Even a lowliest villager 

could dare tell the Commander of the Faithful that he would set him straight like a spindle if he de-

viates an inch from the poth of righteousness. This shows that the rulers and the officials in the Isla-

mic State are answerable both to God and man for their actions, and the people have every right to 

criticise. not only their public behaviour, but even their private activities. 

In the context of such heavy responsibilities the heading of the Islamic State or assumption of any 

other important portfolio in its set-up is a very difficult job so much so that that Holy Prophet (may 

peace be upon him) compared it to the slaughtering of one with a blunt knife. No person, therefore. 

who is conscious of the responsibilities of the job, covets to assume that; he rather shirks it and ac-

cepts it only when he is compelled to do so. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) declared that 

person to be quite unfit for office in an Islamic State who is covetous of it, as he is either ignorant of 

its grave responsibilities or desires to take undue advantage of his official power. 

We enumerate below some of the important rights and duties of an Islamic State. 

As for the rights, the Islamic State can claim full loyalty from all its citizen wholehearted coopera-

tion in all sectors of life and complete obedience to the law of the land and the commands of the ru-

lers so long as they are in comformity with the Laws of the Shari'ah. But where the rulers transgress 

1135 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 20: THE BOOK ON GOVERNMENT (KITAB AL-IMARA)

the limits of the citizens have the right, not only to withdraw co-operation, but also to check the ru-

lers from acting against the Commands of Aliah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him). 

The citizens are also required to pay taxes due to the State quite willingly and not to misappro-

priate its funds, and to participate in Jihad in any capacity for which they are deemed fit by the aut-

horities of the Islamic State. 

So far as the duties of the Islamic State are concerned, the first and foremost duty is to protect the 

life, property and honour of every citizen, irrespective of his caste, creed, colour, religion or social 

status. 

Moreover, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to protect the freedom and individual liberty of 

every citizen so long as there is no valid reason to curtail it. It cannot be done as an arbitrary act. The 

State is authorised to lay hands upon it through due process of law. 

Again, freedom of expression is one of the fundamental rights of the citizen which an Islamic State 

must respect. 

Then, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to see that no citizen remains unprovided for in respect 

of the basic necessities of life, viz, food, othing, shelter, medical aid and education, for the Holy Pro-

phet (may peace be upon him) said:" The government is the guardian of those who have no guardi-

an." 

Moreover, the State is bound to create such conditions in which the good reigns supreme in the 

society and evil is suppressed and exterminated, and its citizens learn to live as good Muslims.

your successor. He said: Should I carry the burden of conducting your affairs in my life as well as in 

my death? (So far as Caliphate is concerned) I wish I could acquit myself (before the Almighty) in a 

way that there is neither anything to my credit nor anything to my discredit. If I would appoint my 

successor, (I would because) one better than me did so. (He meant Abu Bakr.) If I would leave You 

alone, (I would do so because) one better than me, i. e. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon

understood that he would not appoint anyone as Caliph.

Hafsa. She said: Do yoa know that your father is not going to nominate his successor? I said: He won't 

do that (i. e. he would nominate). She said: He is going to do that. The narrator said: I took an oath 

that I will talk to him about the matter. I kept quiet until the next morning, still I did not talk to him, 

and I felt as if I were carryint, a mountain on my right hand. At last I came to him and entered his 

apartment. (Seeing me) he began to ask me about the condition of the people, and I informed him 

(about them). Then I said to him: I heard something from the people and took an oath that I will 

communicate it to you. They presume that you are not going to nominate a successor. If a grazer of 

camels and sheep that you had appointed comes back to you leaving the cattle, you will (certainly) 

think that the cattle are lost. To look after the people is more serious and grave. (The dying Caliph) 

was moved at my words. He bent his head in a thoughtful mood for some time and raised it to me 

and said: God will doubtlessly protect His religion. If I do not nominate a successor (I have a prece-

dent before me), for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not nominate his succes-

Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) was brushing his teeth with a tooth-stick. He said (to me): 

Abu Musa (or 'Abdullah b. Qais), what do you say (about the request they have made)? I said: By God 

Who sent thee on thy mission with truth, they did not disclose to me what they had in their minds, 

and I did not know that they would ask for a position. The narrator says (while recalling this hadith): 

I visualise as if I were looking at the miswak of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) between 

his lips. He (the Holy Prophet) said: We shall not or shall never appoint to the public offices (in our 

State) those who with to have them, but you may go, Abu Musa (or Abdullah b. Qais) (to take up 

your assignment). He sent him to Yemen as governor. then he sent Mu'adh b. jabal in his wake (to 

help him in the discharge of duties). When Mu'adh reached the camp of Abu Musa, the latter (recei-

ved him and) said: Please get yourself down; and he spread for him a mattress, while there was a 

man bound hand and foot as a prisoner. Mu'adh said: Who is this? Abu Musa said: He was a Jew. He

embraced Islam. Then he reverted to his false religion and became a Jew. Mu'adh said: I won't sit un-

til he is killed according to the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him) (in this 

case). Abu Musa said: Be seated. It will be done. He said: I won't sit unless he is killed in accordance 

with the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him). He repeated these words thrice. 

Then Abu Musa ordered him (to be killed) and he was kilied. Then the two talked of standing in 

prayer at night. One of them, i. e. Mu'adh, said: I sleep (for a part of the night) and stand in prayer

ge of Sadaqa (i. e. authorised hign to receive Sadaqa from the people on behalf of the State. When he 

returned (with the collictions), he said: This is for you and (this is mine as) it was presented to me as

praised God and extolled Him. Then he said: What about a State official whom I give an assignment 

and who (comes and) says: This is for you and this has been presented to me as a gift? Why didn't he 

remain in the house of his father or the house of his mother so that he could observe whether gifts 

were presented to him or not. By the Being in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, any one of you 

will not take anything from it but will bring it on the Day of Judgment, carrying on his neck a camel 

that will be growling, or a cow that will be bellowing or an ewe that will be bleating. Then he raised

(i. e. obey them). God (Himself) will question them about the subjects whom He had entrusted to 

them.

Book 020, Number 4544: 

The same tradition has been transmitted by a different chain of narrators.

Book 020, Number 4545: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah who said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: After me there will be favouritism anad many things that you will not like. They (his 

Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, what do you order that one should do it anyone from us has 

to live through such a time? He said: You should discharge your own responsibility (by obeying your 

Amir), and ask God to cuncede your right (by guiding the Amir to the right path or by replacing him 

by one more just and God-fearing).

Book 020, Number 4546: 

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abd Rabb al-Ka'ba who said: I entered 

the mosque when 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As was sitting in the shade of the Ka'ba and the people had 

gathered around him. I betook myself to them and sat near him. (Now) Abdullah said: I accompanied 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on a journey. We halted at a place. Some of us be-

gan to set right their tents, others began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began 

to graze their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) an-

nounced that the people should gather together for prayer, so we gathered around the Messenger of 

Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: It was the duty of every Prophet that has gone before me to 

guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and warn them against what he knew was 

bad for them; but this Umma of yours has its days of peace and (security) in the beginning of its 

career, and in the last phase of its existence it will be afflicted with trials and with things disagreea-

ble to you. (In this phase of the Umma), there will be tremendous trials one after the other, each ma-

king the previous one dwindle into insignificance. When they would be afflicted with a trial, the be-

liever would say: This is going to bring about my destruction. When at (the trial) is over, they would 

be afflicted with another trial, and the believer would say: This surely is going to be my end. Whoe-

ver wishes to be delivered from the fire and enter the garden should die with faith in Allah and the 

Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by them. He who swears allegiance to 

a Caliph should give him the piedge of his hand and the sincerity of his heart (i. e. submit to him 

both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should obey him to the best of his capacity. It another man 

comes forward (as a claimant to Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the Muslims) should be-

head the latter. The narrator says: I came close to him ('Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As) and said to him: 

Can you say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? He 

pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind retained it. I 

said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu'awiya, orders us to unjustly consume our wealth among our-

selves and to kill one another, while Allah says:" O ye who believe, do not consume your wealth

among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves. 

Verily, God is Merciful to you" (iv. 29). The narrator says that (hearing this) Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-

As kept quiet for a while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to God; and diqobey him 

in matters involving disobedience to God.

discharge our obligations towards them, but they (themselves) do not discharge their own responsi-

bilities towards us? What do you order us to do? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 

avoided giving any answer. Salama asked him again. He (again) avoided giving any answer. Then he 

asked again-it was the second time or the third time-when Ash'ath b. Qais (finding that the Holy 

Prophet was unnecessarily being pressed for answer) pulled him aside and said: Listen to them and 

obey them, for on them shall he their burden and on you shall be your burden.

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about the good times, but I used to ask him about bad 

times fearing lest they overtake me. I said: Messenger of Allah, we were in the midst of ignorance 

and evil, and then God brought us this good (time through Islam). Is there any bad time after this 

good one? He said: Yes. I asked: Will there be a good time again after that bad time? He said: Yes, but 

therein will be a hidden evil. I asked: What will be the evil hidden therein? He said: (That time will 

witness the rise of) the people who will adopt ways other than mine and seek guidance other than 

mine. You will know good points as well as bad points. I asked: Will there be a bad time after this 

1154 / 1800

good one? He said: Yes. (A time will come) when there will be people standing and inviting at the ga-

tes of Hell. Whoso responds to their call they will throw them into the fire. I said: Messenger of Allah, 

describe them for us. He said: All right. They will be a people having the same complexion as ours 

and speaking our language. I said: Messenger of Allah, what do you suggest if I happen to live in that 

time? He said: You should stick to the main body of the Muslims and their leader. I said: If they have 

no (such thing as the) main body and have no leader? He said: Separate yourself from all these facti-

ons, though you may have to eat the roots of trees (in a jungle) until death comes to you and you are 

in this state.

Book 020, Number 4554: 

It his been narrated through a different chain of transmitters, on the authority of Hudhaifa b. al-

Yaman who said: Messenger of Allah, no doubt, we had an evil time (i. e. the days of Jahiliyya or 

ignorance) and God brought us a good time (i. e. Islamic period) through which we are now living 

Will there be a bad time after this good time? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. I said: Will there be a 

good time after this bad time? He said: Yes. I said: Will there be a bad time after good time? He said: 

Yes. I said: How? Whereupon he said: There will be leaders who will not be led by my guidance and 

who will not adopt my ways? There will be among them men who will have the hearts of devils in 

the bodies of human beings. I said: What should I do. Messenger of Allah, if I (happen) to live in that 

time? He replied: You will listen to the Amir and carry out his orders; even if your back is flogged 

and your wealth is snatched, you should listen and obey.

Book 020, Number 4555: 

It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 

upon him) said: One who defected from obedience (to the Amir) and separated from the main body 

of the Muslims-if he died in that state-would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyya 

(i. e. would not die as a Muslim). One who fights under the banner of a people who ate blind (to the 

cause for which they are fighting. i. e. do not know whether their cause is just or otherwise), who 

gets flared up with family pride, calls, (people) to fight for their. family honour, and supports his kith 

and kin (i. e. fignts not for the cause of Allah but for the sake of this family or tribe) -if he is killed (in 

this fight), he dies as one belonging to the days of Jhiliyya. Whoso attacks my Umma (indiscriminate-

ly) killing the righteous and the wicked of them, sparing not (even) those staunch in faith and fulfil-

ling not his promise made with those who have been given a pledge of security-he has nothing to do 

with me and I have nothing to do with him.

their bad deeds. One who sees through their bad deeds (and tries to prevent their repetition by his 

band or through his speech), is absolved from blame, but one who hates their bad deeds (in the heart 

of his heart, being unable to prevent their recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) fafe ( so far 

as God's wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them is spiri-

tually ruined. People asked (the Holy Prophet): Shouldn't we fight against them? He replied: No, as 

long as they say their prayers.

It has been narrated (through a different chain of tmnamitters) on the authority of Umm Salama

doing good as well as bad deeds. One who hates their bad deeds is absolved from blame. One who 

disapproves of their bad deeds is (also) safe (so far as Divine wrath is concerned). But one who ap-

proves of their bad deeds and imitates them (is doomed). People asked: Messenger of Allah, shouldn't 

we fight against them? He replied: No, as long as they say their prayer. (" Hating and disapproving" 

refers to liking and disliking from the heart.)

those whom you hate and who hate you and whom you curse and who curse you. It was asked (by 

those present): Shouldn't we overthrow them with the help of the sword? He said: No, as long as they 

establish prayer among you. If you then find anything detestable in them. You should hate their ad-

ministration, but do not withdraw yourselves from their obedience.

curse. (Those present) said: Shouldn't we overthrow them at this? He said: No, as long as they esta-

blish prayer among you. No, as long as they establish prayer among you. Mind you! One who has a 

governor appointed over him and he finds that the governor indulges in an act of disobedience to 

God, he should condemn the governor's act, in disobedience to God, but should not withdraw himself 

from his obedience. Ibn Jabir said: Ruzaiq narrated to me this hadith. I asked him: Abu Miqdam, have 

you heard it from Muslim b. Qaraza or did he describe it to you and he heard it from 'Auf (b. Malik) 

and he transmitted this tradition of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Upon this Ruzaiq

thee that they will not associate in worship anything with God, that they will not steal. that, they will 

not commit adultery..." to the end of the verse (lx. 62).

Chapter 1: Hunting with the help of trained dogs 

Book 021, Number 4732: 

'Adi b. Hatim reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, I set off trained dogs and they catch for me (the 

game) and I recite the came of Allah over it (I slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-

Akbar), whereupon he said: When you set off your trained dogs and you recited the name of Allah 

(while setting them off), then eat (the game). I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the 

game)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which 

you did not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I throw 

Mi'rad, a heavy featherless  blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game). Thereupon he said: 

When you throw Mi'rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly (and beats the game to death), 

then do not eat that.

Book 021, Number 4733: 

'Adi b. Hatim reported: I asked Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying: We are a peo-

ple who hunt with these (trained) dogs, then (what should we do)? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) 

said: When you set of your trained dogs having recited the name of Allah, then eat what these 

(hounds) have caught for you, oven if it (the game) is killed, provided (the hunting dog) has not ea-

ten (any part of the game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don't eat it as I fear that it might have 

caught for its own self. And do not eat in case other dogs have joined your trained dogs.

Book 021, Number 4734: 

'Adi b. Hatim reported that he asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about (hun-

ting) with the help of an arrow having a stub end. He said: If it strikes (the game) with its point, then 

eat, but if it strikes flatly and it dies, that is Waqidh (beaten into death), do not eat that. I asked the 

Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he 

said. When you send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if 

some part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that (the-game) 

for itself. I (again) said: If I find along with my dog another dog, and do not know which of (the 

dogs) has caught (the game). then (what should I do)? Thereupon he ('Allah's Messenger) said: Then 

don't eat that, for you recited the name of Allah on your dog and not on the other one.

but if it strikes flat, that is (the game is) beaten (into death), (then do not eat that) 'Adi further said: I 

asked him about hunting with the help of a dog, whereupon he said: If that (the dog) catches it (the 

game) for you and does not eat out of that, then you eat (the game) for Dhakat (slaughtering) of that 

is its being caught by it (by the dog). But if you find another dog besides it, and you fear that that dog 

(the second one) had caught it (the game) along with that (your dog) and killed it. then don't eat; for 

you recited the name of Allah on your dog and did not recite that on the other one (which joined 

your dog incidentally).

ging to the People of the Book and so you eat in their utensils, but if you can get utensils other than 

theirs, then don't eat in them; but if you do not find any, then wash them and eat in them. And regar-

that just as a baby sucks and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. 

We beat off leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then 

went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something like a big 

mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-'Anbar (spermaceti whale). 

Abu 'Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by the Mes-

senger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account 

of the scarcity of food), so you eat that. We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until 

we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavi-

ty of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu 'Ubaida called 

forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold of one of 

the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and 

it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves with pieces of boiled meat (especially 

for use in our journey). When we came back to Medina, we went to Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah 

had brought forth for you. Is there any piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that? He 

(Jabir) said: We sent to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) tome of that (a piece of meat) 

and he ate it.

Book 021, Number 4757: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) sent us (on an expedition). 

We were three hundred riders and our chief (leader) was 'Ubaida b. al-Jarrah. We were on the look 

out for a caravan of the Quraish. So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much aff-

licted by extreme hunger that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detach-

ment of the Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-'Anbar (whale). We ate 

of that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became stout. Abu 

'Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance at the tallest man of the 

army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over that, and that-tnan passed beneath 

it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from 

the cavity of its eye. We had small bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). 'Ubaida 

gave every person amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave 

each one of us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.

Book 021, Number 4758:

red three camels, then three, then three, then Abu 'Ubaida forbade him (to do so fearing that the ri-

des may become short).

those people might have been distorted in the shape of lizards). So he neither commanded (us to eat

BOOK 22: THE BOOK OF SACRIFICES (KITAB AL-ADAHI)

Introduction 

Religion, at its highest and best, is the devotion of the total self, through service and adoration, to 

the Almighty Who controls the universe. In this sense all the manifold rites, consecrations, and puri-

fications, offerings and sacred feasts, all the working of asceticism and morality are only the indirect 

expression of the inner experience of religion-the experience of trust, surrender, yearning and en-

thusiasm. Sacrifice, whether that of wealth or desires, is the practical proof of man's devotion to his 

Creator. It is in fact religion in action. 

The Holy Qur'an expresses this attitude of mind and heart in the following words:" Say: Truly, my 

prayer and my service of sacrifice, and my living and my dying are for God (alone), the Sustainer of 

all the worlds, in Whose Divinity none has a share. Thus I have been bidden-and I am foremost 

among those who surrender themselves unto Him" (vi. 162-163). 

The 'Id al-Adha is commemorative of that unparalleled act of devotion of that noble soul. Abraham 

(peace be upon him), who, in obedience to the Command of his Lord, readily offered the life of his 

son Isma'il. The Holy Qur'an narrates this soul- stirring event in these words:" And when he (Isma'il) 

attained the age to assist him in his (Abrahm's) work, he (Abraham) said: O my son! I see in vision 

that I offer thee in sacrifice. Now see what is thy view. The son said: O my father, do as thou art com-

manded. Thou wilt find me, if God so wills, patient. So when they both had surrendered themselves 

to (Allah), and he laid him down prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice), We called out to him: O 

Abraham, thou hast indeed fulfilled the vision. Thus do We reward the doers of good. Surely this is a 

manifest trial. And We ransom- ed him with a great sacrifice. And We left (this blessing) for him 

among the later generations. Peace be upon Abraham I Thus indeed do We reward those who do 

good; for he was one of Our believing servants" (xxxvii. 102-111) 

In the above-quoted verses 'axim (great), the adjective qualifying" Sacrifice." may be understood 

both in literal and figurative sense. In literal sense it implies that a big ram was substituted. The figu-

rative sense is even more important. It was indeed a great and momentous occasion, when two men 

with concentrated will ranged themselves in ranks of those to whom self-sacrifice in the service of 

God was the supreme thing in life. Similarly, the words" thou hast indeed fulfilled the vision" show 

that it was not in fact the act of slaughtering which was needed for the fulfilment of the vision, but it 

was the attitude of submission and surrender, an attitude of preparedness to sacrifice one's all in the 

path of Allah. that was demanded of Abraham and his illustrious son, and they eminently stood this 

test. 

Readiness to Sacrifice One's Life. In Islam the act of sacrifice is the symbol of a Muslim's readiness 

to lay down his life, and to sacrifice all his interests and desires in the cause of truth. The purpose of 

sacrifice is not fulfilled only by shedding the blood of an animal, but it is really fulfilled when a man 

submits himself completely to the command of Allah. This has been clearly laid down in Sura Hajj, 

verse 37;" Not their flesh, nor their blood reaches Allah, but it is the piety from you that reaches

BOOK 22: THE BOOK OF SACRIFICES (KITAB AL-ADAHI)

Him." This verse eloquently speaks of the fact that sacrifice in Islam is nothing else than a natural ex-

pression of homage and gratitude to the Creator. It is the spirit of willing devotion and cheerful obe-

dience underlying sacrifices that is accepted by Allah Who is the Fountainhead of all morality. It is 

only piety of heart. nobility of soul and righteousness of conduct, that is acceptable to Him. It is es-

sentially symbolic, an external symbol of dedication, devotion to Allah. Tafsir Ibn Kathir stresses this 

point:" The man who offers sacrifice should keep this fact uppermost in his mind that the most im-

portant motive behind this is the willing submission to Allah" ' (Vol. VI, p. 183). 

Such truths, so self-evident to the Muslim readers, needed a clear and emphatic enunciation in 

view of the horrible misconceptions which had crowded round the act of sacrifice before Islam. 

" Throughout the Semitic field," observes Robertson Smith, in his well known book. The Religion of 

the Semitics, the fundamental idea of sacrifice was that of communion between the God and his 

worshipper by joint participation in the living flesh and blood of a sacred victim" (p. 49). 

" The Greeks also looked upon sacrifice as a 'Communion feast' with the Divinity, in which the God 

and his people became of one flesh by partaking together of the flesh of the victim; the animal was 

regarded, as in some degree, divine, as having the divine spirit incarnate in it. Among the Babylo-

nians the gods feast in heaven, they eat the offerings, they scent the savour, like flies do they gather 

themselves   together   with   the   offerers"   (Hastings,   Encyclopedia   of   Rdigion   &   Ethics,   Article" 

Sacrifice" ). 

The Holy Qur'an strikes at the very root of such wrong concepts of sacrifice and asserts that" it is 

neither the flesh nor the blood of (animals) that reaches Allah, but it is your piety that reaches Him," 

for God does not stand In need of food or blood. What He, in fact, desires is the devotion and piety of 

our hearts. and, as a symbol of such offer, the visible institution of sacrifice has been instituted. The 

Holy Qur'an has further elucidated the main parpose of the institution of sacrifice." For every people 

did We appoint rites (of sacrifice) that they might celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He 

gave them from animals (fit for food). But your God is One God. Sub- mit then your wills to him (in 

Islam).... The sacrificial camels We have made for you as among the symbols from God. In them is 

(much) good for you So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then when they fall 

down on their sides, eat of them, feed the contented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them 

subservient to you that you may be grateful" (xxii. 34-38). 

The Qur'an testifies to the historical fact that whatever may be the outward symbols of sacrifice, it 

has been accepted in one form or another by all the nations of the world. It had been a fundamental 

element of both Jewish and Gentile religions, and Christianity. It had been corrupted by many wrong 

practices and been overlaid by many wrong notions before the advent of Islam. Islam purifies it from 

all wrong notions and practices connected with it, and makes it explicitly clear that the act of sacri-

fice is an outward symbol of man's readiness to lay down his life, if required, and to surrender all his 

interests in the cause of truth and righteousness.

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 22: THE BOOK OF SACRIFICES (KITAB AL-ADAHI)

The words" We have made them (subservient) to you" have a very wide significance. A Muslim has 

been awakened to the realisation of the fact that if they offer as a sacrifice an animal over which 

they hold control, it is their bounden duty to lay down their lives in the way of Allah, Who is not 

only their Master, but also their Creator and Sustainer and Who. therefore, exercises a far greater 

authority over them than they do over the animals. This should be the true motive of sacrifice, and it 

is with this spirit that this act should be performed. 

The Qur'anic words" To Him is acceptable observance of duty on your part" make it abundantly 

clear that the prevalent idea of atonement that" it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul" 

(Leviticus; 17: 11) has no foundation in Islam. The expiation of sin in Islam rests entirely on the good 

deeds of men, repentance of the Winners and the Forgiving and Merciful nature of God 'This fact 

cuts the ground from under the feet of any theory of an atoning sacrifice. 

The opening verse" For every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice) that they might celebrate 

the name of God over the beast cattle wherewith He bath provided them," speaks of the fact that the 

very idea of human sacrifice is repugnant to the true religion and Allah has never given it sanction. 

This practice of human sacrifice was not uncommon before Islam." Both on the mainland of Gree-

ce and in the Greek colonies human sacrifice was practised, usually as a means towards expulsion of 

evil" (Encydopaedia Britannica, Article'on" Sacrifice" ). it occupied a prominent place in the ritual of 

the mother goddesses of ancient times. 

" The ordinary form of sacrifice," says E. O. James, in his famous book, The origins of Sacrifice," 

consisted in stripping the victim of his ornaments, stretching him over the convex sacrificial stones 

and while fare priests held his arms, legs, head, the high priests or sacrificer cut open his breast with 

a flint or obsidian knife, and tore out the heart. This was held up to the sun to provide it with nouris-

hment, before it was cast into a basin of Copal placed in a position to enable the blood and incense to 

ascend to the gods. The body was hurled down the steps of the temple to the court where it was sei-

zed by the priest or by the warrior who captured the victim. Some times a solemn feast was then held 

on the flesh, the skin having first been removed to be worn ceremonially by men who seem to have 

acquired thereby the fertilising nd health-giving qualities of the victim. Some of the blood was car-

ried to certain temples and smeared on the hips of the images of gods" (pp. 84-6). 

Islam has not only exterminated the very idea of human sacrifice, but has completely ended all 

such inhuman practices which were very common with the people before Islam. The Holy Qur'an 

makes a pointed reference to the fact that this sacrifice of animals is commemorative of Abraham's 

offer of his son's life at the Command of Allah, who was substituted by a ram, and it has been perpe-

tuated by Islam. It is narrated that once the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) asked him about the sacrifice. He replied:" This is commemorative Sunnah of your father Abra-

ham" (vide Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, p. 221). That this practice of sacrifice was already prevalent amongst 

the people before Islam can be well borne out by the fact that we find clear references to it in the 

poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The well. known poet Umayya observes: 

1218 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 22: THE BOOK OF SACRIFICES (KITAB AL-ADAHI)

Abraham was one who would fulfil the pledges and offer sacrifices for Allah's sake. 

Thus he offered the life of his only son whose separation and whose risk of life, he could not bear. 

He said," O my son I have pledged you to Allah. 

May I sacrifice my life for you! 

Be steadfast and firm." 

He had hardly taken off the shirt of his son, when Allah substituted Isma'il by a stout ram. 

Not only this practice of sacrifice has been preserved in Islam, but even the way of Abraham's has 

been declared to he one of righteousness and truthfulness: 

" Say: Behold, my Lord has guided me to a way that is straight-a religion of Right Path-the Path 

(trodden) by Abraham, who was wholly devoted to God, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to 

any beside him" (vi. 161). 

Even the Millat has been assigned a name after the name of Abraham: 

" He hath selected you and hath not placed upon you any hardship in religion-the religion of your 

father, Abraham. He named you Muslims before this, and in this, that the Messenger may be a wit-

ness to you and you may he witnesses to mankind" (xxii. 78). 

Historical Continuity, The constant reference to the earlier Prophets and the Qur'anic testimony to 

their righteousness and the preservation of some of their religious practices have been done to awa-

ken the people to the realisation of a fundamental fact, i. e. the fact of the historical continuity of re-

ligious experience. The Muslims have been asked to believe in that which has been revealed unto 

Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as well as in that which was revealed before him. 

Life-so the Qur'an teaches us-is not a series of disconnected parts but a continuous, organic process: 

and this law applies also to the law of the mind, of which man's religious experience (in its cumula-

tive sense) is a part. To make religious experience more living, to set Allah the Ever-living with lo-

ving vividness before the eyes of living men, to make them feel Him as actually and eternally present 

in their lives, man needs a path, clear-cut path, lightened with glories of the Messengers of Allah-a 

path on which one should not feel lonely but the strength of comradeship of those noble souls upon 

whom Allah has bestowed His choicest blessings. 

A few words may be said about the way how an animal should be slaughtered according to the te-

achings of Islam. Three are the aims which should be kept before the mind while slaughtering the 

animal: 

It should be slaughtered by reciting the name of Allah and glorifying Him. 

1219 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 22: THE BOOK OF SACRIFICES (KITAB AL-ADAHI)

It should be slaughtered with a sharp knife so that its jugular vein may be cut with the minimum 

possible pain and its skin should not be removed and limbs should not be cut so long as there is any 

sign of life in it. 

The head should not be removed from the body abruptly but only the jugular vein should be cut 

so that even the last drop of blood flows out of its body. If the animal is beheaded with a stroke, the 

blood congeals in its veins which makes the flesh distasteful and pernicious to health.

Book 022, Number 4818: 

Jundab b. Sufyan reported: I was with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the day of 

'Id al-Adha. While he had not returned after having offered (the Id prayer) and finished it, he saw 

the flesh of the sacrificial animals which had been slaughtered before he had completed the prayer. 

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: One who slaughtered his sacrificial animal before his prayer 

or our prayer ('Id), he should slaughter another one in its stead, and he who did not slaughter, he 

should slaughter by reciting the name of Allah.

slaughter a goat (again) in its stead and he who has not slaughtered he should slaughter it by reci-

ting the name of Allah.

bours and my kith and kin. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Offer again 

your sacrifice. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have a small milch goat of less than one year, and that is 

better than two dry goats (from which only) meat (can be acquired). Thereupon he said: That is bet-

who slaughtered the (animal on that day before the 'Id prayer), for him (the slaughtering of animal

Book 023, Number 4879: 

'Ali b. Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted 

me another camel. I made them kneel down one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry 

on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass) in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of 

Qainuqa'. I saught to give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of 

that (the price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drin-

king in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said: Hamza, get up 

for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and cut off their humps 

and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab: Did he take out any-

thing from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn Shihab reported 'Ali having said: 

I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) 

and there was Zaid b, Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the com-

pany of Zaid and I also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with 

him. Hamza raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from them.

that day out of the Khums (one-fifth reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my 

mind to consummate my marriage with Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (may peace be

might bring Idhkhir wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my 

wedding feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two she-ca-

mels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the different 

articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their 

haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I could not help weeping when I saw 

that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that? They said: Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib has done this. 

and he is in this house dead drunk in the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing 

before him and his companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-ca-

their haunches and tore out their livers. 'Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) recognised from my face what I had experienced, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be

(such an unfortunate day) as this day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has 

cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drun-

kards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it 

on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of the hou-

se) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. 

and they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to reprimand Hamza for 

what he had done. Hamza's eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and 

then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my fa-

led, such and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their stomachs. He (the narrator) said. I do 

not know whether it is the narration transmitted by Anas, (or by someone else). Then Allah, the Exal-

was ahead of the people; and I came to my wife and she said (to me): You will be humbled. I said: I 

did what you had asked me to do. She (his wife) said: I brought out the kneaded flour and Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) put some saliva of his in that and blessed It. He then put saliva 

in the earthen pot and blessed it and then said. Call another baker who can bake with you. and bring 

out the soup from it, but do not remove it from the hearth, and the guests were one thousand. (Jabir 

said): I take an oath by Allah that all of them ate (the food to their fill) until they left it and went

Dahhak (another narrator) said: It (the flour) was in the same condition and loaves had been prepa-

Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Talha said to Umm Sulaim: I felt some feebleness in the voice of

anything with you? She said: Yes. She brought out barley loaves, then took out a head-covering of 

hers, in a part of which she wrapped those loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and cover-

ed me with a part of it. She then sent me to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I set forth 

and found Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sitting in the mosque in the company of some 

persons. I stood near them, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Has Abu 

Talha sent you? I said, Yes. He said: Is it for a feast? I said. Yes. Thereupon Allah's messenger (may

them, until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talba said: Umm Sulaim, here comes Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with people and we do not have enough (food) to feed 

them. She said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Abu Talha went out (to receive him) Until he 

met Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) came

forward along with him until they both (Allah's Messenger, along with Abu Talha) came in. Then Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Umm Sulaim. bring forth that which you have with 

you. She brought the bread. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that the bread 

be broken into small pieces, and when Umm Sulaim had squeezed a small waterskin and put seaso-

ning on it, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited something regarding it what Allah 

wished him to say. He then said: Allow ten (guests to come in and have their meals). He permitted 

them; they ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Permit

tion of Abu Talha. He (the Holy Prophet) asked the people to get up. Thereupon Abu Talha said: Al-

lah's Messenger, I have prepared something for you. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

touched (the food) and invoked blessings upon it, and then said: Let ten persons from my Compan-

ions enter (the house). He then said: Eat, and (in the meanwhile) brought out something from bet-

ween his fingers for them. They then began to eat until they had their fill and then went out. He then 

asked ten more men (to have the meal) and they ate to their fill, and the ten persons went on getting 

in (and eating the food) and then getting out until none was left amongst them who had not got in 

and eaten to his fill. He then collected (the remaining part of the food) and it (the quantity of the 

food) was the same (as it had been prior to the serving of guests).

Anas b. Malik reported: I visited Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) one day and found 

him sitting in the company of his Companions and talking to them, and he had tied his belly with a 

bandage. Usama said: I am in doubt whether there was stone on that (his belly) or not. I asked some 

of his Companions why Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had bandaged his belly. They 

said: (He has done that to relieve) his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the 

daughter of Milhan, and said to him: Father, I saw Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) ha-

ving bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said that it was 

due to hunger. Abu Talha came to mv mother and said: Is there anything? She said: Yes, I have some 

pieces of bread with me and some dates. If Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) comes to us 

alone we can feed him to his fill, but if someone comes along with him this would be insufficient for 

them. The rest of the hadith is the same.

Miqdad reported: I and two of my companions were so much afflicted by hunger that we had lost 

our power of seeing and hearing. We presented ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Holy 

Prophet (may peace be upon him), but none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person 

amongst us drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him). 

(It was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner that 

would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go to the mos-

que and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night the Satan came to me 

when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the Ansar, who would offer him 

hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no need for this draught (of milk). So I 

took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain 

that there was no way out (but to digest it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe 

be to thee! what have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he 

would come and he would not find it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there 

would go (waste) this world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pul-

led) it upon my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were unco-

vered, and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what I 

had done. There came Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he greeted as he used to greet 

(by saying as-Salamu 'Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer and then came to 

his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky, 

and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was going to invoke curse upon me and I would be 

thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who 

provided me drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of 

the knife and went to the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them 

were milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and milked them in that 

until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he said:

(Abu Bakr) then came (back to his own house) when (a considerable) part of the night had been 

over, as Allah had desired. His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! 

have you not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them. but 

they refused to eat until you came. He ('Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid myself. He (Abu 

Bakr) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the guests: Eat, though it may 

not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He ('Abd al-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did 

not take a morsel when from beneath that (there appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, 

and lo! it was more than what it was before. Abu Bakr saw that and found that it was so or more 

than that. He said to his wife: Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. 

it is in excess by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr ate saying: That was from the Sa-

tan (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it (the rest) 

to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and it was kept there until morning, and during 

(those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people, and the period of covenant 

was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every person amongst them. It is Allah only 

Who knows as to how many people were there with each of them. He sent (this food to them) and all

'Abd al-Rahman b. Abd Bakr reported: There came to our house some guests. It was a common 

practice with my father to (go) and talk to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) during the 

night. While going he said: 'Abd al-Rahman, entertain the guests. When it was evening we served the 

food to them, but they refused saying: So long as the owner of the house does not come and join us, 

we would not take the meal. I said to them: He ('Abd Bakr) is a stern person, and if you would not do 

that (if you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my father) 

came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the peopleof the household) 

said: We have not served them sofar. He said: Did I not command 'Abd al-Rahman (to do this)? He 

('Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and kept myself away by that time. He again said: O stupid fel-

low, I ask you on oath that In case you hear my voice you come to me. I came and said: By Allah, the-

re is no fault of mine. These are your guests; you may ask them. I provided them with food but they 

refused to eat until you came. He said to them: Why is it that you did not accept our food? By Allah, I 

shall not even take food tonight (as you have not taken). They said: By Allah, we would not take until 

you join us. Thereupon he Abu Bakr) said: I have never seen a more unfortunate night than this. Woe 

be to thee! that you do not accept from us food prepared for you. He again said: What I did first (that 

is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by the Satan. Bring the food. The food was 

brought, and he ate by reciting the name of Allah and they also ate, and when it was morning he 

came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, their oath (that of the 

guests) came to be true, but mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole incident. 

He said: Your oath came to be the most true and you are the best of them. He (the narrator) said. I do 

not know whether he made an atonement for it.

that I should name him after that (sacred) name until I have asked Allah's Apostle (may peace be

BOOK 26: THE BOOK ON SALUTATIONS AND GREETINGS (KITAB AS-SALAM)

Introduction 

Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way the words of greetings which are ex-

changed amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a society. The gestures, and the expressions of 

salutations are, therefore, the indicators of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The com-

mon practice with the pre-Islamic Arabs and the modern West is to greet one another with Good 

Morning and Good Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These 

words have no spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one's mornings 

and evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the time 

of meeting are as-Salam-u-'Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance behind 

them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within and peace without, 

it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on every occasion when two 

Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be constantly inculcated in the mind of 

every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness of the great reality that he lives in this world as 

a messenger of peace for mankind. peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important 

feature of words of greeting in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person 

who is greeted but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the 

blessing of peace. (The pronoun'Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come within its 

orbit.) 

The two words as-Salam-u-'Alaikum may be called the irreducible minimum which are essential 

for greeting one another. The Muslims have been commanded to add to this expression some other 

words with a view to excelling one another in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-

Salam-u-'Alaikum are generally suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of 

Allah and His bleasings). These three words:" peace..., mercy" and" blessings of Allah" in fact form the 

sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another these benedicti-

ons. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in perfect peace and tranquillity 

and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. 

According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of as-Salam-u-'Alaikum is a Sunnah, and 

responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby 

that if a few persons out of the whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of 

the responsibility of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsi-

ble for it.

side of Hijaz on the way to Syria), there met him the commander of the forces, Abu Ubaida b. Jandb, 

and his companions. They informed him that a scourge had broken out in Syria. Ibn 'Abbas further 

reported that 'Umar said: Call to me tile earliest emigrants. So I called them. He (Hadrat 'Umar) 

sought their advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a diffe-

rence   of   opinion   (whether   they   should   proceed   further   or   go   back   to   their   homes   in   such   a 

situation). Some of them said: You ('Umar) have set forth for a task, and, therefore, we would not ad-

vise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along with you the remnants (of the sacred 

galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we 

would not advise you to go forth towards this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose 

them deliberately to a danger). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: You can now go away. He said: Call to me the 

Ansar. So I called them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden 

by the Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can go. 

He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the Victory (that is 

the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and Hadrat 'Umar consulted them) and not even two persons 

differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They said: Our opinion is that you better go 

back along with the people and do not make them go to this scourge, So 'Umar made announcement 

to the people: In the morning I would be on the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), 

whereupon Abu 'Ubaida b. Jarrah said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereu-

pon 'Umar said: Had it been someone else to say this besides you! 'Umar (in fact) did not approve of 

his opposing (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine 

Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in a valley 

having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren, would you not (be 

doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And in case you graze them in 

the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according to the Divine Decree.

There happened to come 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf and he had been absent in connection with some

(of meteor)? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, 

used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of 

anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He deci-

des to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of 

heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of this 

world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: 

What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of 

heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the heaven of the world. In this 

process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his fri-

ends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack them with meteors. If they narrate only which 

they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.

then came back and found his wife standing between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by 

jealousy and made a dash towards her with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear 

away and enter the house until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a 

big snake coiled on the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having 

fixed it in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died

Book 029, Number 5613: 

Abu Salama reported: I used to see dreams (and was so much perturbed) that I began to quiver 

and have temperature, but did not cover myself with a mantle. I met Abu Qatada and made a menti-

on of that to him. He said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A good visi-

on comes from Allah and a (bad) dream (hulm) from devil. So when one of you sees a bad dream 

(hulm) which he does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from 

its evil; then it will not harm him.

Book 029, Number 5614: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Qatada, but there is no mention of the 

words of Abu Salama:" I saw dreams (which perturbed me) but I did not cover myself with a mantle."

Book 029, Number 5615: 

This hadith has been reported on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters, but it 

does not contain the words:" I felt disturbed because of that," and there is an addition of these words 

in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Yunus:" Then spit thrice on the left side when you get 

up from sleep."

Book 029, Number 5616: 

Abu Qatada reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A good vision is from 

Allah and a bad dream (hulm) is from the satan; so if one of you sees anything (in a dream which he 

dislikes, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, and then it will 

never harm him. Abu Salama said: I used to see dreams weighing more heavily upon me than a 

mountain; but since I heard this hadith I don't care for it (its burden).

Book 029, Number 5617: 

Abu Salama reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I used to see dreams, 

but the hadith transmitted on the authority of Laith b. Nu'man, the words of Abu Salama at the con-

cluding part of the hadith are not mentioned. Ibn Rumh has reported in the hadith:" He (one who 

sleeps) should change the side on which he had been lying before."

Book 029, Number 5618: 

Abu Qatada reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The good vision are 

from Allah and the evil dreams are from the satan. If one sees a dream which one does not like, one 

should spit on one's left side and seek the refuge of Allah from the satan; it will not do one any harm, 

and one should not disclose it to anyone and if one sees a good vision one should feel pleased but 

should not disclose it to anyone but whom one loves.

Book 029, Number 5619: 

Abu Salama replied: I used to see (such horrible dreams) that I fell ill. I saw Abu Qatada who also 

said: I used to see dreams which made me sick until I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) as saying: Good dreams are from Allah, so if any one of you sees which he likes he should not 

disclose it to one but whow he loves, but if he sees something which he does not like he should spit 

on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from the mischief of the satan and its mischief (i. e. 

of the dream), and he should not relate it to anyone, then it would not harm him.

draws near (when the Resurrection is near) a believer's dream can hardly be false. And the truest vi-

sion will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-

fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings 

from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of 

one's own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and of-

fer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), 

but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one's steadfastness in religion. 

The narrator said: I do not know whether this is a part of the hadith or the words of Ibn Sirin.

Book 029, Number 5622: 

Abu Huraira reported: I love to see fetters but I hate necklace (in a dream), for fetters signifies

Book 029, Number 5643: 

It is reported eithfr on the authority of Ibn Abbas or on the authority of Abu Huraira that a person 

came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, I saw while I was 

sleeping during the night (this vision) that there was a canopy from which butter and honey were 

trickling and I also saw people collecting them in the palms of their hands, some more, some less, 

and I also saw a rope connecting the earth with the sky and I saw you catching hold of it and rising 

towards the heaven; then another person after you catching hold of it and rising towards (Heaven) ; 

then another person catching hold of it, but it was broken while it was rejoined for him and he also 

climbed up. Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger, may my father be sacrificed for you, by Allah, allow 

me to interpret it. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sail: Well, give its interpretation. The-

reupon Abu Bakr said: The canopy signifies the canopy of Islam and that what it trickles out of it in 

the form of butter and honey is the Holy Qur'an and its sweetness and softness and what the people 

get hold of it in their palms implies major portion of the Qur'an or the small portion; and so far as 

the rope joining the sky with the earth is concerned, it is the Truth by which you stood (in the 

worldly life) and by which Allah would raise you (to Heaven). Then the person after you would take 

hold of it and he would also climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it 

and climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and it would be broken; 

then it would be rejoined for him and he would climb up with the help of it. Allah's Messenger, may 

my father be taken as a ransom for you, tell me whether I have interpreted it currectly or I have 

made an error. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You have interpreted a part of it 

correctly and you have erred in interpreting a part of it. Thereupon he said: Allah's Messenger, by 

Allah, tell me that part where I have committed an error. Thereupon he said: Don't take oath.

that I was brandishing a sword and its upper end was broken and this is what fell (in the form of 

misfortune to the believers on the Day of Ubud). I brandished (the sword) for the second time and it 

became all right and this is what came to be true when Allah granted us victory and solidarity of the 

believers. And I saw therein cows also and Allah is the Doer of good. These meant the group from

(may peace be upon him) along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and the Prophet of Allah (may peace 

be upon him) had a piece of wood in his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company of 

his companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would never give it to you. I am not 

going to do anything against the will of God in your case, and if you turn away (from what I say) Al-

lah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I was shown (in the dream) and here is 

Thabit and he would answer you on my behalf. He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn 'Abbas

same what I was made to see about you in my dream." and Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Mes-

senger. (may peace be upon him) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my hands two gold bangles. 

This had a disturbing effect upon me and I was given a suggestion in the sleep that I should blow 

over them, so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted these (two bangles) as the 

two great liars who would appear after me and the one amongst them was 'Anasi the inhabitant of

said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to 

that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I 

come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a 

thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether 

they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, 

and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the foun-

tain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al

him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. 

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who 

amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the jour-

ney until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and 

then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of 

Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa'ida, 

and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to 

him: Did you not see that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the 

Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and 

said: Allah's Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the 

end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.

Book 030, Number 5664: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Amr b. Yahya with the same chain of transmit-

ters up to the words: There is good in all the houses of the Ansar, and there is no mention of the sub-

Jabir b. Abdullah reported: We went along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an 

expedition  towards   Najd  and  Allah's  Messenger  (may   peace  be  upon   him)   found   us  in   a  valley 

abounding in thorny trees. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stayed for rest under a tree 

and he suspended his sword by one of its branches under which he was taking rest. The persons 

scattered in the valley and they also began to take rest under the shade of trees, and Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) said: A person came to me while I was asleep and he took hold of the

sword. I woke up and found him standing upon my head and I had hardly become alert (and saw) 

that the sword was in his hand. And he said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He again 

said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He put his sword in the sheath (and you can see) 

this man sitting here. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not in any way touch him.

Book 030, Number 5666: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansiri, who was one amongst the Companions of Allah's Apostle (may peace

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back he also came back along with him. They, for 

one day, stayed for rest; the rest of the hadith is the same.

Chapter 5: Pertaining to the similitude with which Al-

lah's apostle (may peace be upon him) has been 

sent with guidance and knowledge 

Book 030, Number 5668: 

Abu Musa reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of that gui-

dance and knowledge with which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has sent me is that of rain falling 

upon the earth. There is a good piece of land which receives the rainfall (eagerly) and as a result of it 

there is grown in it herbage and grass abundantly. Then there is a land hard and barren which re-

tains water and the people derive benefit from it and they drink it and make the animals drink. Then 

there is another land which is barren. Neither water is retained in it, nor is the grass grown in it. And 

that is the similitude of the first one who develops the understanding of the religion of Allah and it 

becomes a source of benefit to him with which Allah sent me. (The second one is that) who acquires 

the knowledge of religion and imparts it to others. (Then the other type is) one who does not pay at-

tention to (the revealed knowledge) and thus does not accept guidance of Allah with which I have 

been sent.

and of that with which Allah sent me is that of a person who came to us and said: O people, I have 

seen an army with my eyes and I am a plain warner (and issue you warning) that you should imme-

diately manage to find an escape. A group of people from amongst them paying heed (to his war-

ning) fled to a place of protection and a group amongst them belied him and the morning overtook 

them in their houses and the army attacked them and killed them and they were routed. And that is 

the similitude of the one who obeyed me, followed with which I had been sent and the similitude of 

the other is of one who disobeyed and belied me and the Truth with which I have been sent.

fall into the fire, but I am there to hold them back, but they are plunging into it despite my efforts,

mine and that of the Apostles (before me) is that of a person who constructed a building and he built 

it fine and well and the people went round it saying: Never have we seen a building more imposing 

than this. but for one brick, and I am that brick (with which you give the finishing touch to the buil-

ding).

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of 

mine and that of the Apostles before me is that of a person who built a house quite imposing and be-

autiful and he made it complete but for one brick in one of its corners. People began to walk round 

it, and the building pleased them and they would say: But for this brick your building would have 

been perfect. Muhammad (may peace be upon him) said: And I am that final brick.

Apostles.

but for the space of a brick. People entered therein and they were surprised at it and said: Had there

there would come to me people whom I would know and who would know me. Then there would be 

intervention between me and them. Abu Hazim said that Nu'man b. Abu 'Ayyash heard it and I nar-

rated to them this hadith, and said: Is it this that you heard Sahl saying? He said: Yes, and I bear wit-

ness to the fact that I heard it from Abu Sa'id Khudri also, but he made this addition that he (the Holy 

Prophet) would say: They are my followers, and it would be said to him: You do not know what they 

did after you and I will say to them: Woe to him who changes (his religion) after me.

equal and its water is whiter than silver, and its odour is more fragrant than the fragrance of musk, 

and its jugs (placed round it) are like stars in the sky; and he who would drink from it would never 

feel thirsty after that. Asma', daughter of Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: I would be on the Cistern and so that I would be seeing those who would be coming to me from 

you, but some people would be detained (before reaching me). I would say: My Lord, they are my 

followers and belong to my Umma, and it would be said to me: Do you know what they did after 

you? By Allah, they did not do good after you, and they turned back upon their heels. He (the narra-

tor) said: lbn Abu Mulaika used to say (in supplication): O Allah, I seek refuge with Thee that we 

should turn back upon our heels or put to any trial about our religion.

you; they had been constantly turning back on their heels (from their religion).

Book 030, Number 5686: 

Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), said I used to hear from people 

making a mention of the Cistern, but I did not hear about it from Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him). One day while a girl was combing me I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) say:" O people." I said to that girl: Keep away from me. She said: He (the Holy Prophet) has ad-

dressed the men only and he has not invited the attention of the women. I said: I am amongst the 

people also (and have thus every right to listen to the things pertaining to religion). Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) said: I shall be your harbinger on the Cistern; therefore, be cautious 

lest one of you should come (to me) and may be driven away like a stray camel. I would ask the rea-

sons, and it would be said to me: You don't know what innovations they made after you. And I would 

then also say: Be away.

and, by Allah, I perceive as if I am seeing with my own eyes my Cistern at this very state and I have 

been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys of the earth and, by Allah, I am not afraid

it (the Cistern) would never feel thirsty. There would flow in it two spouts from Paradise and he who

lah's Messenger, Anas is a prudent young boy, and he will serve you. He (Anas) said: I served him in

do. I went out until I happened to come across children who had been playing in the street. In the 

meanwhile, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came there and he caught me by the back of 

my neck from behind me. As I looked towards him I found him smiling and he said: Unais, did you 

go where I commanded you to go? I said: Allah's Messenger, yes, I am going. Anas further said: I ser-

Saif, the wife of a blacksmith who was called Abu Saif. He (the Holy Prophet) went to him and I fol-

lowed him until we reached Abu Saif and he was blowing fire with the help of blacksmith's bellows 

and the house was filled with smoke. I hastened my step and went ahead of Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) and said: Abu Saif, stop it, as there comes Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon 

him). He stopped and Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) called for the child. He embraced him 

and said what Allah had desired. Anas said: I saw that the boy breathed his last in the presence of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). The eyes of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)

father was a bricksmith. He took him (his son Ibrihim) and kissed him and then came back. 'Amr

re was presented to me the Paradise and Hell in the nook of this enclosure, and I did not see good

them was) that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said Jesus son of Mary saw a person 

committing theft; thereupon Jesus said to him: You committed theft. He said: Nay. By Him besides 

Whom there is no god (I have not committed theft). Thereupon Jesus said: I affirm my faith in Allah 

It is my ownself that deceived me.

Book 030, Number 5848: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying Prophet Ibrahim (pe-

ace be upon him) never told a lie but only thrice: two times for the sake of Allah (for example, his 

words):" I am sick," and his words:" But it was the big one amongst them which has done that" and 

because of Sara (his wife). He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with 

Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that 

you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister 

and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I 

and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): 

'there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someo-

ne (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when 

she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand 

was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. 

She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more 

tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but 

he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous 

occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I 

shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought 

her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human 

being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with 

Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: 

With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-ser-

vant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.

(may peace be upon him) and one, of them speaks that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

is reported to have said: Banu Isra'il used to take bath (together) naked and thus saw private parts of 

one another, but Moses (peace be upon him) used to take bath alone (in privacy), and they said: By 

Allah, nothing prevents Moses to take bath along with us; but scrotal hernia. One day when he (Mo-

ses) was taking bath (alone) he placed his clothes upon a stone, but the stone began to move along 

with his clothes. Moses raced after it saying: My garment, stone; until (some of the people) of Banu

COMPANIONS (KITAB AL-FADA'IL)

Isra'il looked at the private parts of Moses, and they said: By Allah, there is no trouble with Moses. 

The stone stopped after he (Moses) had been seen. He took hold of his garments and struck the stone. 

Abu Huraira said: I swear by Allah that there were six or seven scars on the stone because of the stri-

king of stone by Moses (peace be upon him).

Book 030, Number 5850: 

Abu Huraira reported that Moses was a modest person. He was never seen naked and Banu Isra'iI 

said: (He was afraid to expose his private part) because he had been suffering from scrotal hernia. He 

(one day) took bath in water and placed his garments upon a stone. The stone began to move on 

quickly. He followed that and struck it with the help of a stone (saying): O stone, my garment; O sto-

ne, my garments, O stone; until it stopped near the big gathering of Isrii'll, and this verse was revea-

led (pertaining to the incident):" O you who believe, be not Iike those who maligned Moses, but Allah 

cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah" (xxxiii. 69).

Book 030, Number 5851: 

Abu Huraira reported that the Angel of Death was sent to Moses (peace be upon him) to inform of 

his Lord's summons. When he came, he (Moses) boxed him and his eye was knocked out. He (the An-

gel of Death) came back to the Lord and said: You sent me to a servant. who did not want to die. Al-

lah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight), and then said: Go back to him and 

tell him that if he wants life he must place his hand on the back of an ox, and he would be granted as 

many years of life as the number of hair covered by his hand. He (Moses) said: My Lord what would 

happen then He said: Then you must court death. He said: Let it be now. And he supplicated Allah to 

bring him close to the sacred land. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If I 

were there, I would have shown you his grave beside the road at the red mound.

Book 030, Number 5852: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said that the Angel of 

Death came to Moses and said: Respond (to the call) of Allah (i. e. be prepared for death). Moses (pe-

ace be upon him) gave a blow at the eye of the Angel of Death and knocked it out. The Angel went 

back to Allah (the Exalted) and said: You sent me to your servant who does not like to die and he 

knocked out my eye. Allah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight) and said: Go 

to My servant and say: Do you want life? And in case you want life, keep your hand on the body of 

the ox and you would live such number of years as the (number of) hair your hand covers. He (Mo-

ses) said: What, then? He said: Then you would die, whereupon he (Moses) said: Then why not now? 

(He then prayed): Allah, cause me to die close to the sacred land. Allah's Messenger (may peace be

the red mound. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ma'mar.

Book 030, Number 5853: 

Abu Huraira reported: While a Jew was selling goods, he was given something which he did not 

accept or he did not agree (to accept) that 'Abdul 'Azlz (one of the narrators) is doubtful about it. He 

(the Jew) said: By Allah, Who chose Moses (peace be upon him) among mankind. A person from the 

Ansar heard it and gave a blow at his face saying: (You have the audacity) to say: By Him Who chose 

Moses amongst mankind, whereas Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) is living amongst us. 

The Jew went to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Abu'l-Qasim, I am a Dhimmi 

and (thus need your protection) by a covenant, and added: Such and such person has given a blow 

upon my face. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Why did you give a blow 

on his face? He said: Allah's Messenger, this man said: By Him Who chose Moses (peace be upon 

him) amongst mankind, whereas you are living amongst us. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) became angry and signs of anger could be seen on his face, and then said: Don't make distincti-

on amongst the Prophets of Allah. When the horn will be blown and whatever is in the heavens and 

the earth would swoon but he whom Allah grants exception, then another horn will be blown and I 

would be the first amongst those who would recover and Moses (peace be upon him) would be cat-

ching hold of the Throne and I do not know whether it is a compensation for that when he swooned 

on the Day of Tur or he would be resurrected before me and I do not say that anyone is more excel-

lent than Yunus son of Matta (peace he upon him). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 

Abu Salama with the same chain of transmitters.

Book 030, Number 5854: 

Abu Fluraira reported that two persons, one from amongst the Jews and the other from amongst 

the Muslims, fell into dispute and began to abuse one another. The Muslim said: By Him Who chose 

Muhammad (may peace be upon him) in the worlds. And the Jew said: By Him Who chose Moses in 

the worlds. Thereupon the Muslim lifted his hand and slapped at the face of the Jew. The Jew went to 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and told him about his affair and the affair of the Mus-

lim. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) laid: Don't make me superior to Moses 

for mankind will swoon and I would be the 'first to recover from it and Moses would be at that time 

seizing the side of the Throne and I do not know (whether) he would swoon and would recover be-

fore me or Allah would make an exception for him.

he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka'b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up 

to give sermon to the people of Isra'il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best 

knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him 

that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My ser-

vants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I 

meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing 

there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha'). Joshua 

b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the 

young man (Yusha') until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep 

and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like 

a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and 

they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this 

incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the 

breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they 

had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don't you know that when 

we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. 

could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was 

what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there 

they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in 

our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra'il? 

He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Al-

lah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah's knowledge 

which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: 

May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He 

said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not 

know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If 

you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He 

said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. 

Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.

They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in 

the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you at-

tempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grie-

vous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me 

not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat 

and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. 

Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in 

no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not 

say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous

than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company 

with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until 

they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to en-

tertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about 

to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came 

but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for 

it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the 

significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) 

story of both of them could have been told. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the 

first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on 

the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your 

knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the spar-

row in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa'id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 

and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force 

which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.

Book 030, Number 5865: 

Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn 'Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that 

Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra'il. He said: Sa'id, did you 

hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka'b nar-

rated to us that he had heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been 

delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better 

knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is 

better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. 

Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for 

journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a 

young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he 

proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed 

the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah's Apostle (peace be upon 

him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he 

(Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and 

he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet 

Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the 

fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it'? It is strange that he has been able to find 

way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.

SAHIH MUSLIM BOOK 30: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE EXCELLENT QUALITIES OF THE HOLY PROPHET (MAY PEACE BE UPON THEM) AND HIS

They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) 

the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a 

cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-'Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face 

and said: Wa 'Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: 

Moses Of Bani Isra'il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach 

me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how 

can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not 

have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you 

will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don't ask me 

about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Kha-

dir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the 

persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you 

that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I for-

got and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on un-

til they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold'of one 

(apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have 

killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and 

Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect 

to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. 

You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have 

seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention 

of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. 

They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. 

They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to 

them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereu-

pon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partin-

ce, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the 

real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belon-

ged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them 

(a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so 

he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by 

very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would 

have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in 

its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys 

in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse. This hadith 

has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.

pened to pass Ubayy b. Ka'b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has 

been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he 

wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah's meesenger (may peace be upon him) 

making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as 

saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra'il, there came to him a person and he said to 

him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah re-

vealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than 

you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where 

you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wis-

hed him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop 

that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don't you see that as we had re-

ached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I 

should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced 

their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except

Chapter 1: The merits of Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be 

pleased with him) 

Book 031, Number 5868: 

Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Bakr Siddiq reported him thus: I saw the feet of the polytheists 

very close to us as we were in the cave. I said: Allah's Messenger, if one amongst them were to see at 

his feet he would have surely seen us. Thereupon he said: Abu Bakr, what can befall twain who have 

Allah as the third One with them.

Book 031, Number 5869: 

Abu Sa'id reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sat on the pulpit and said: Al-

lah gave a choice to His servant that he may opt the beauties of the world or that which is with Him 

and the servant chose that which was with Him. Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and 

said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous 

toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose 

anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish 

Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr's 

window.

Book 031, Number 5870: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri through another chain of 

transmitters.

Book 031, Number 5871: 

'Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If I were to

brother and my companion and Allah, the Exalted and Gliorious. has taken your brother and compa-

nion (meaning Prophet himself) as a friend.

you, and it seemed as if she meant that he might die. Thereupon he said: If you do not find me, then 

come to Abu Bakr.

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jubair b. Mut'im through another chain of

Book 031, Number 5879: 

A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in his (last) illness asked me to 

call Abu Bakr, her father, and her brother too, so that he might write a document, for he feared that 

someone else might be desirous (of succeeding him) and that some claimant may say: I have better 

claim to it, whereas Allah and the Faithful do not substantiate the claim of anyone but that of Abu 

Bakr.

the needy? Abu Bakr said: It is I. He (again) said: Who amongst you has today visited the sick? Abu

driving an ox loaded with luggage. The ox looked towards him and said: I have not been created for 

this but for lands (i. e. for ploughing the land and for drawing out water from the wells for the pur-

pose of irrigating the lands). The people said with surprise and awe: Hallowed be Allah, does the ox 

speak? Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I believe it and so do Abu Bakr and 'Umar. 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A shepherd was tendi-

Ibn Abu Mulaika reported: I heard Ibn 'Abbas as saying: Wlien 'Umar b. Khatab was placed in the 

coffin the people gathered around him. They praised him and supplicated for him before the bier 

was lifted up, and I was one amongst them. Nothing attracted my attention but a person who gripped 

my shoulder from behind. I saw towards him and found that he was 'All. He invoked Allah's mercy 

upon 'Umar and said: You have left none behind you (whose) deeds (are so enviable) that I love to 

meet Allah with them. By Allah, I hoped that Allah would keep you and your two associates together. 

I had often heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I came and there came too 

Abu Bakr and 'Umar; I entered and there entered too Abu Bakr and 'Umar; I went out and there went 

out too Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and I hope and think that Allah will keep you along with them.

things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camelg. I heard Allah's Messenger (may pe-

said to him: Allah's Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Aren't you satisfied with being unto me what 

Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) 

heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Al-

lah and his Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We have 

been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call 'Ali. He was called and his eyes 

were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave 

him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:" Let us summon 

our children and your children." Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called 'Ali, Fitima, Ha-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called 'Ali b. Abu Talib and he conferred (this honour) 

upon him and said: Proceed on and do not look about until Allah grants you victory, and 'Ali went a 

bit and then halted and did not look about and then said in a loud voice: Allah's Messenger, on what 

issue should I fight with the people? Thereupon he (the Prophet) said: Fight with them until they 

bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger, and when

Messenger (may peace be upon him) all of them hoping that that would be given to him. He (the 

Holy Prophet) said: Where is 'Ali b. Abu Talib? They said: Allah's Messenger, his eyes are sore. He 

then sent for him and he was brought and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) applied saliva 

to his eyes and invoked blessings and he was all right, as if he had no ailment at all, and coraferred 

upon him the standard. 'Ali said: Allah's Messenger, I will fight them until they are like us. Thereu-

pon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Advance cautiously until you reach their open places, thereafter in-

vite them to Islam and inform them what is obligatory for them from the rights of Allah, for, by Al-

that you saw Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) listened to his talk, fought by his side in 

(different) battles, offered prayer behind me. Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, nar-

rate to us what you heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: I have grown 

old and have almost spent my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in 

connection with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so accept whatever I narrate to you, 

and which I do not narrate do not compel me to do that. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) stood up to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated 

between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon and. exhorted 

(us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger

I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right

to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of 

your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his 

household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the mem-

bers of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is 

forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the

Would you like to ride upon my camel tonight and allow me to ride upon your camel and you would 

see (what you do not generally see) and I would see (what I do not see) generally? She said: Yes. So 

'A'isha rode upon the camel of Hafsa and Hafsa rode upon the camel of 'A'isha and Allah's Messenger

ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he 

made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made 

me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I 

sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart's content. The mother 

of Abu Zara', how fine is the mother of Abu Zara'! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in 

her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara' is con-

cerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn 

forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter 

of Abu Zara' is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara', obedient to her father, obedient to 

her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of 

Abu Zara', how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now 

to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu'l-'As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke 

the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she 

may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger cannot be combined with the 

daughter of God's enemy (as the co-wives) of one person. Thereupon 'Ali gave up (the idea of his in-

tended) marriage. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to you secretly and you wept and then said to you some-

thing secretly and you laughed? Thereupon she said: He informed me secretly of his death and so I

her. What did Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) say to you? Thereupon she said: I am not 

going to disclose the secret of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). When Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) died, I said to her: I adjure you by the right that I have upon you that you 

should narrate to me what Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to you. She said: Yes, 

now I can do that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me 

that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur'an along with him once or twice every year, but this 

year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he 

told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me. And when he 

saw me in grief he talked to me secretly for the second time and said: Fatima, are you not pleased 

that you should be at the head of the believing women or the head of this Umma? I laughed and it 

was that laughter which you saw.

of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I ('A'isha) said: I have not seen (anything happening) 

like today, the happiness being more close to grief (as I see today) when she wept. I said to her: Has 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) singled you out for saying something leaving us aside? 

She then wept and I asked her what he said, and she said: I am not going to divulge the secrets of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). And when he died I again asked her and she said that he 

(the Holy Prophet) told her: Gabriel used to recite the Qur'an to me once a year and for this year it 

was twice and so I perceived that my death had drawn near, and that I ('A'isha) would be the first 

amongst the members of his family who would meet him (in the Hereafter). He shall be my good fo-

rerunner and it made me weep. He again talked to me secretly (saying): Arn't you pleased that you 

should be the sovereign amongst the believing women or the head of women of this Umma? And this 

made me laugh.

said to the members of her family: Do not narrate to Abu Talha about his son until I narrate it to him. 

Abu Talha came (home) ; she presented to him the supper. He took it and drank water. She then em-

bellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and 

when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some 

people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its re-

turn, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son. He 

was annoyed, and said: You did not inform me until I had a sexual intercourse with you and you la-

ter on gave me information about my son. He went to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

and informed him what had happened. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: 

May Allah bless both of you in the night spent by you! He (the narrator) said: She became pregnant. 

Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) was in the course of a journey and she was along with 

him and when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back to Medina from the journey 

he did not enter (his house) (during the night). When the people came near Medina, she felt the 

pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah's Messenger 

when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. 

Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better pro-

ceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child 

was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning. And when it was morning I carried him (the child) 

and went along with him to Allah's Messenger (may peace beupon him). He said: I saw that he had in 

his hand the instrument for the cauterisation of the camels. When he saw me. he said: This is, per-

haps, what Umm Sulaim has given birth to. I said: Yes. He laid down that instrument on the ground. I 

brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become 

palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face 

and named him 'Abdullah.

Book 031, Number 6046: 

'Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon 

the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with 

our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you 

are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he 

accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. 

We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal 

uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped 

by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They 

both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number 

along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my 

meeting with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He 

said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I 

used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at 

the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. 

Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.

Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met 

a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I 

said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. 

Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no 

way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words can-

not be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until 

I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from 

amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me say-

ing: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down 

unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I 

came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brot-

her, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. 

And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger 

in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none 

was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of 

Isafa, and Na'ila (the two idols).

They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dis-

suade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols' private 

parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These 

women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have 

taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He as-

ked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the 

Ka'ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as 

we cannot express. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone 

and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he 

had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and 

uttered (these words) in this way; Allah's Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he 

said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tri-

be of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps 

he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.

I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded 

me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I 

have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There 

has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles 

upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as 

food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along 

with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the 

first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah's Messenaer 

(may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it 

cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on 

my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais 

and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified 

(to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also 

embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother 

and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophe-

thood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe 

embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi' b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the 

tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to 

Medina, and when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half 

also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and 

said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they

also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted 

pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.

Book 031, Number 6047: 

This hadlth has been narrated on the authority of Humaid b. Hilal with the same chain of trans-

mitters but with this addition:" As I came to Mecca, Unais said: (Well), go but be on your guard 

against the Meccans for they are his enemies and are annoyed with him."

Book 031, Number 6048: 

Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: Son of my brother, I used to observe prayer two 

years before the advent of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him). I said: To which direction did 

you turn your face? He said: To which Allah directed me to turn my face. The rest of the hadith is the 

same but with this addition that they went to a Kahin and his brother Unais began to praise him un-

til he (in verses declared) him (Unais) as winner (in the contest of poetry), and so we got his camels, 

mixed them with our camels, and there is in this hadith also these words that Allah's Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) came there and he circumambulated the House and observed two Rak'ahs of 

prayer behind the Station (of Ibrahim). I came to him and I was the first amongst persons to greet 

him with Assalam-o-'Alaikum, and I said to Allah's Messenger Let there be peace upon you. And he 

said: Let there be peace upon you too; who are you? And in the hadith (these words are) also found: 

Since how long have you been here? And Abu Bakr said: Let him be my guest tonight.

Book 031, Number 6049: 

Ibn 'Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the advent of the Apostle (may peace be upon 

him) in Mecca he said: Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the person 

who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens. Listen to his words and then 

come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the 

Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to de-

velop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I 

have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up 

provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to 

Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka'ba) and began to find out Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon 

him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask 

about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. 'All saw him and found him to be a stranger. 

So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about any-

thing until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a 

day there, but he did not see Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then re-

turned to his bed that there happened to pass 'Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his 

destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry 

from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. 'Ali made him 

stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why 

don't you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provi-

ded you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He ('Ali) 

said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is 

morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would 

stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in 

(some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him). He entered (the house) of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened 

to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to 

him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him 

in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set 

forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to 

the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people at-

tacked him and made him fall down when 'Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be 

upon you, don't you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Sy-

ria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same 

on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he res-

cued him.

mission to see him since I embraced Islam and never looked at me but with a smile.

Book 031, Number 6051: 

Jarir reported: Since I embraced Islam Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) never refused 

to see me and he did not see me but with a smile on his face. Ibn Numair has made this addition to 

this hadith which has been reported on the authority of Ibn Idris that he (Jarir) made this complaint 

to him (to  the Holy Prophet): I cannot sit  upon the horse with firmness, whereupon he  (Allah's 

Apostle) struck his chest with his hand and prayed: O Allah, make him steadfast and rightly-guided.

Jabir reported that there was in pre-Islamic days a temple called Dhu'l- Khalasah and it was cal-

led the Yamanite Ka'ba or the northern Ka'ba. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said unto 

me: Will you rid me of Dhu'l-Khalasah and so I went forth at the head of 350 horsemen of the tribe 

of Ahmas and we destroyed it and killed whomsoever we found there. Then we came back to him (to 

the Holy Prophet) and informed him and he blessed us and the tribe of Ahmas.

Book 031, Number 6053: 

Jarir b. 'Abdullah al-Bajali said: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: Can't on 

rid me of Dhu'I-Khalasah, the idol-house of Khath'am, and this idol-house was called the Yamanite 

Ka'ba. So I went along with 150 horsemen and I could not sit with steadfastness upon the horse. I 

made the mention of it to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he struck his hand on my 

chest and said: O Allah, grant him steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the 

rightly-guided one. So he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir sent some person to Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news about that. 

He came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have not come to you (but with 

the news) that we have left Dhu'l-Khalasah as a scabed camel. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) blessed the horses of Ahmas and the men of their tribe five times.

Book 031, Number 6054: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ismail with different chains of transmitters and

hold of me and they have carried me to the fire, and, lo, it was built like the easing of a well and had 

two pillars like those of a well; and, lo, there were people in it whom I knew and I cried out: I seek 

refuge with Allah from Hell-fire; I seek refuge with Allah from Hell-fire. Then another Angel joined 

the two others, and said unto me: You need not fear I narrated this dream to llafsa and she narrated 

it to Allah's Messenger, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Worthy is this man Abdullah, O that he 

would pray at night, and Silim added that Abdullah afterwards slept only but for a small part of the

verse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the

ple of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not 

know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its 

vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its 

base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to 

me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a hel-

per came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus hel-

ped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the 

handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in 

fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereu-

pon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that hand-

hold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur'an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you

stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people 

of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He ('Abdullah b. Salim) 

said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to 

why they said like it. (The story is) that while I was asleep (one night) there came to me a person (in 

the dream) who asked me to stand up. (So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked 

along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereu-

pon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of 

Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these 

paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell 

upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so 

high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at 

its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches 

the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the 

handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until 

it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) 

and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these 

are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the 

paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the 

martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the 

handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you 

would meet death.

to recite (verses) when one better than you (the Holy Prophet) had been present (here). He then loo-

ked towards Abu Huraira and said to him: I adjure you by Allah (to tell) if you had not heard Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: (Hassan), give a reply on my behalf; Allah I help him 

with Ruh-ul-Qudus. He (Abu Huraira) said: By Allah, it is so (i. e. the Holy Prophet actually said the-

'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be uport him) said. Satirise against the (non-

So he (the Holy Prophet) sent (someone) to Ibn Rawiha and asked him to satirise against them, and he 

composed a satire, but it did not appeal to him (to the Holy Prophet). He then sent (someone) to Ka'b 

b. Malik (to do the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy Prophet). He then sent 

one to Hassan b. Thabit. As he got into his presence, Hassan said: Now you have called for this lion 

who strikes (the enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his tongue and began to move it and 

said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall tear them with my tongue as the leather is torn. 

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don't be hasty; (let) Abu Bakr who has 

the best know- ledge of the lineage of the Quraish draw a distinction for you in regard to my linea-

ge, as my lineage is thesame as theirs. Hassan then came to him (Abu Bakr) and after making inquiry 

(in regard to the lineage of the Holy Prophet) came back to him (the holy Prophet) and said: Allah's 

Messenger, he (Abu Bakr) has drawn a distinction in vour lineage (and that of the Quraish) By Him 

Who has sent you with Truth, I shall draw out from them (your name) as hair is drawn out from the 

flour. 'A'isha said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying to Hassin: Verily 

Ruh-ul- Qudus would continue to help you so long as you put up a defence on behalf of Allah and 

His Messenger. And she said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying: Hassan sa-

You satirised Muhammad. virtuous, righteous,

The Apostle of Allah, whose nature is truthfulness.

So verily my father and his father and my honour

If you had not interfered with us, we would have performed the 'Umra,

And (then) there was the Victory, and the darkness cleared away.

Otherwise wait for the fighting on the day in which Allah will honour whom He pleases.

noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard the noiee of falling of water. 

She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the 

door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mu-

bammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah's Messen-

ger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mo-

I said: Allah's Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother

sactions in the bazar; while the Ansar had been engaged in looking after their properties. (He further 

reported) that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who spreads the cloth would not

Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on 

the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many 

ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that 

they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brot-

hers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transacti-

ons in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had 

been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Al-

my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I 

spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I ne-

Allah's messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. 

Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are 

with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they 

would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find 

some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of 

any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereu-

there is forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:" O you who believe, do not 

take My enemy and your enemy for friends" (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this verse in the ha-

mise that you made with me. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Accept glad ti-

dings. Thereupon the desert Arab said: You shower glad tidings upon me very much; then Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned towards Abu Musa and Bilal seemingly in a state of an-

noyance and said: Verily he has rejected glad tidings but you two should accept them. We said: Al-

called for a cup of water and washed his hands in that and face too and put the saliva in it and then 

said: Drink out of it and pour it over your faces and over your chest and gladden yourselves. They 

took hold of the cup and did as Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had commanded them to

There we met Ja'far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja'far said: Allall's Messenger (may peace be

structed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia

Imran b. Husain reported Allah's-Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The best among

said twice or thrice (the words:" Then next" ) after (saying) about his (own age but he then said): 

Then after them (after successors or those who would succeed them) would come a people who

'Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) led us 'Isha' prayer at 

the latter part of the night and when he had concluded it by salutations he stood up and said: Have 

you seen this night of yours? At the end of one hundred years after this none would survive on the 

surface of the earth (from amount my Companions). Ibn Umar said: People were (not understanding) 

these words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) which had been uttered pertaining 

to one hundred years. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in fact meant (by these words) 

that on that day none from amongst those who had been living upon the earth (from amongst his 

Companions) would survive (after one hundred years) and that would be the end of this generation.

he met Uwais. He said: Are you Uwais b., Amir? He said: Yes. He said: Are you from the tribe of Qa-

ran? He said: Yes. He (Hadrat) 'Umar (again) said: Did you suffer from leprosy and then you were 

cured from it but for the space of a dirham? He said: Yes. He ('Umar) said: Is your mother (living)? 

He said: Yes. He ('Umar) said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: There would 

come to you Uwais b. Amir with the reinforcement from the people of Yemen. (He would be) from 

Qaran, (the branch) of Murid. He had been suffering from leprosy from which he was cured but for 

a spot of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been excellent. If he were to take an 

oath in the name of Allah, He would honour that. And if it is possible for you, then do ask him to beg 

forgiveness for you (from your Lord). So he (Uwais) begged forgiveness for him. Umar said: Where 

do you intend to go? He said: To Kufa. He ('Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, 

whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. When it was the next year, a per-

son from among the elite (of Kufa) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uwais. He 

said: I left him in a state with meagre means of sustenance. (Thereupon) Umar said: I heard Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would come to you Uwais b. 'Amir, of Qaran, a 

branch (of the tribe) of Murid, along with the reinforcement of the people of Yemen. He had been 

suffering from leprosy which would have been cured but for the space of a dirham. His treatment 

with his mother would have been very kind. If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for so-

mething) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible 

for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You 

have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person 

who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have 

just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet 

Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to 

know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His 

clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?

Abu Naufal reported: I saw (the dead body) of Abdullah b. Zubair hanging on the road of Medina 

(leading to Mecca). The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened 

to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of 

Hadrat 'Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon 

you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, 

by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted 

to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Al-

lah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then 

'Abdullah b. 'Umar went away. The stand 'Abdullah (b. 'Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treat-

ment (meted out to 'Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj 

(b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down 

from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He 

(Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma' (bint Abu Bakr, 'Abdullah's mother). But she refused to come. 

He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring 

her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to 

you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me 

my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to 

her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you 

wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that 

you used to call him ('Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a 

woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals 

and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar 

and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find 

anyone else besides you. 'Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.

led him placing her palms upon the eyebrows and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it 

is your mother, so talk to her. She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): 

O Lord, my mother (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She 

(his mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your mother 

(calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my prayer, and he opted for 

prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Al-

lah, don't bring death to him unless he has seen the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon 

him (from the heart of her heart) he would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a she-

pherd living near by his temple (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that 

a woman of that village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she beca-

me pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He is the 

child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and spades. They called 

Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they were about to demolish that 

temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said: Ask her (this woman) what she says. 

He smiled and then touched the head of the child and said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: 

My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to re-

build with gold and silver what we have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with 

clay as it had been before. He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).

Book 032, Number 6188: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle 

but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got 

constructed a temple and confined himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer 

and she said: Juraij. He said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. 

He continued with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in pray-

er, and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in pray-

er, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she again came 

and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while 

I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she said: My Lord, don't give him 

death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and 

prayer gained currency amongst Bani Isra'il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarna-

te. She said (to the people): If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he 

paid no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to 

him and he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth 

to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and demolished the 

temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You have committed fornicati-

on with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from your loins. He said: Where is the 

child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just leave me so that I should observe prayer. And 

he observed prayer and when he finished, he came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O 

boy, who is your father? lie said: He is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and 

touched him (for seeking blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He 

said. No, just rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was 

sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His mother said: 

O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to see towards him, and 

said: O Allah, don't make me like him. He then returned to the chest and began to suck the milk of 

his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am seeing Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and 

sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further reported Allah's Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: 

There happened to pass by him a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have com-

mitted adultery and you have committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is 

my good Protector, and his mother said: O Allah, don't make my child like her and he left sucking the 

milk, and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between 

them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, 

make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and they passed by a girl

while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you committed theft, and I 

said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her. Thereupon he 

said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and they were saying

many questions) from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). So I asked him about virtue and 

vice. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Virtue is a kind disposition and 

vice is what rankles in your mind and that you disapprove of its being known to the people.

who would come on the Day of Resurrecton with prayers and fasts and Zakat but (he would find 

himself bankrupt on that day as he would have exhausted his funds of virtues) since he hurled abu-

ses upon others, brought calumny against others and unlawfully consumed the wealth of others and 

shed the blood of others and beat others, and his virtues would be credited to the account of one 

(who suffered at his hand). And if his good deeds fall short to clear the account, then his sins would 

be entered in (his account) and he would be thrown in the Hell-Fire.

I lose temper just as a human being loses temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom

BOOK 33: THE BOOK OF DESTINY (KITAB-UL-QADR)

Introduction 

Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has 

been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sen-

sible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very 

deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and free-

will. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there 

are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining 

the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein 

and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks 

to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the mea-

sure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which 

he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart 

which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the 

Great and Mighty Power that created him. 

On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he 

looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is 

a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which 

man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. We give below 

a brief summary of their elucidations. 

The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the 

master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Al-

lah's Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefo-

re, stirs without His Will. 

It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. 

He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or 

conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath know-

ledge and power (xlii. 48). 

Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do any-

thing unless God wills so. 

" Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron 

to set him right (xviii. 16). 

His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything 

and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon 

man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is be-

cause of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of hu-

1580 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 33: THE BOOK OF DESTINY (KITAB-UL-QADR)

man responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if 

he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy 

Qur'an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man. 

Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39). 

Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11). 

Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and 

sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102). 

Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 

9). 

Whoever has done an atorn's weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an 

atom's weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8). 

It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur'an does not al-

ways signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possi-

bilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything 

for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything 

according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, 

their latent potentialities or possibilities. 

The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the crea-

ted world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way 

mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of 

Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but some-

thing preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Grea-

test Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set 

and well-planned. 

The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold 

themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived 

of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be in-

terpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a 

storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass 

hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and 

the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity. 

Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:" Divine knowledge 

must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own 

right are organically related. By conceiving God's knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no 

doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His 

1581 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 33: THE BOOK OF DESTINY (KITAB-UL-QADR)

freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God's creative life, but it pre-exists 

as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines." 

We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is con-

ceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The 

whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of 

creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows 

it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator. 

The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandon-

ment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His 

will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, 

by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one's inherent possi-

bilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It 

is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a 

powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It 

does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of 

hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as 

assigned to him by his Master.

ther and his destiny in regard to his livelihood, his 

deeds, both good and evil 

Book 033, Number 6390: 

Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who is the most 

truthful (of the human beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) said: Verily your creation is on this 

wise. The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother's womb in the form of 

blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump 

of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so 

the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besi-

des Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until bet-

ween him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of des-

tiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another 

one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a 

cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise 

and enters Paradise.

angel says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And both these things are written. And his deeds

fari and said: How can a person be an evil one without (cornmittilng an evil) deed? Thereupon the 

person said to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) as saving: When forty nights pass after the semen gets into the womb, Allah sends the an-

gel and gives him the shape. Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, 

his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires 

and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord 

decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down. Then he says: My Lord, what about his livelihood? 

And then the Lord decides as He likes and the angel writes it down, and then the angel gets out with

Paradise or Hell has not been allotted and about whom it has not been written down whether he 

would be an evil person or a blessed person. A person said: Allah's Messenger, should we not then

which they did not act upon? I said: Of course, it is something which is predetermined for them and 

preordained for them. He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish them)? I felt 

greatly disturbed because of that, and said: Everything is created by Allah and lies in His Power. He 

would not be questioned as to what He does, but they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: 

May Allah have mercy upon you, I did not mean to ask you but for testing your intelligence. Two 

men of the tribe of Muzaina came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's 

Messenger, what is your opinion that the people do in the world and strive for, is something decreed 

for them; something preordained for them and will their fate in the Hereafter be determined by the 

fact that their Prophets brought them teachings which they did not act upon. and thus they became 

deserving of punishment? Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and

Glorious:" Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety"

anything deficient in them? Then he quoted the Qur'an., The nature made by Allah in which He has 

created men there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion" (xxx. 33)

you find any deficiency in their limbs? You cut their ears (i. e. after birth). They (the Companions of 

the Holy Prophet) said: What is your opinion about him who dies in infancy? Thereupon Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: It is Allah alone Who knows best what they would be doing.

upon him) said: You have asked from Allah about durations of life already set, and the length of days 

already allotted and the sustenances the share of which has been fixed. Allah would not do anything 

earlier before its due time, or He would not delay anything beyond its due time. And if you were to 

ask Allah to provide you refuge from the torment of the HellFire, or from the torment of the grave, it 

would have good in store for you and better for you also. He (the narrator) further said: Mention was 

made before him about monkeys, and Mis'ar (one of the narrators) said: I think that (the narrator) 

also (made a mention) of the swine, which had suffered metamorphosis. Thereupon he (the Holy 

Prophet) said: Verily, Allah did not cause the race of those which suffered metamorphosis to grow or 

they were not survived by young ones. Monkeys and swine had been in existence even before (the 

metamorphosis of the human beings).

Allah about the durations of life already set, and the steps which you would take, and the suste-

nances the share of which is fixed. Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing 

would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the 

torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person 

said: Allah's Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereu-

pon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not 

destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even

BOOK 35: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH, SUPPLICATION, REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

(KITAB AL-DHIKR)

Introduction

Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous outpourings of man's heart before his Lord, but it 

is an expression of his sense of nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His 

mercy, grace and blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he suppli-

cates about, and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his 

soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before its Creator. 

The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality of the faith that is imprin-

ted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his thought and activity. Thus to understand the 

spirit of any religion and appraise its value to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The 

Prophet (may peace be upon him) was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made suppli-

cations to his Lord with zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. 

One who cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the 

Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great Master, 

his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine Mercy and unf-

linching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before Him. These are in fact 

the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern of the Prophet's (may peace be 

upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a Muslim has been instructed to make 

whether singly or in congregation, whether at the appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden 

call or urge to His Lord, reflects the one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. 

Whatever is the state of spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly 

in his mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the supplications 

in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal name of God, i. e. Allah, is 

used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called out in order to make the worshipper cons-

cious of his own weak and dependent self before his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help 

and grant him what he desires, and at the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself 

through the realisation of what God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own 

inner life. 

While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, 

it covers the whole range of human life with all its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds 

expression in a deep and urgent longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive 

situation, forgiveness of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Her-

eafter. This consciousness of one's absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock 

of the Prophet's (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man's attitude of perfect resignation 

before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the spirit of despondence 

and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that the Being Who is the Lord of man's 

fate can also help him and save him even in the most trying circumstances.

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 35: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH, SUPPLICATION, REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

(KITAB AL-DHIKR)

The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) eminently combine in themselves the 

mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undistur-

bed with concentrated gaze one Supreme Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of 

all values. But, unlike mystics, he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself 

but realises himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and unwa-

vering confidence in God. 

The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications taught by Muhammad (may peace be 

upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit of social fellowship. They do not urge man 

to stand face to face with God in absolute loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein 

the suppliant begs his Lord with the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling 

that the distress which vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the 

salvation for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity. There 

is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in these supplications, 

but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which the soul is supposed to be uni-

fied with God losing all its individual identity. Here the soul has a communion with Allah with full 

consciousness of man's own self, his social surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the 

supplications have been expressed in the form" We" and Us". 

Chapter 1: Exhortation for the remembrance of Allah, 

the Exalted 

Book 035, Number 6471: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah, the Exal-

ted and Glorious, thus stated: I am near to the thought of My servant as he thinks about Me, and I am 

with him as he remembers Me. And if he remembers Me in his heart, I also remember him in My 

Heart, and if he remembers Me in assembly I remember him in assembly, better than his (remem-

brance), and if he draws near Me by the span of a palm, I draw near him by the cubit, and if he 

draws near Me by the cubit I draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands. And if he walks 

towards Me, I rush towards him.

Book 035, Number 6472: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters, but

death to me when there is goodness in death for me.

Where have you come from? They say: We come from Thine servants upon the earth who had been 

glorifying Thee (reciting Subhan Allah), uttering Thine Greatness (saying Allah o-Akbar) and utte-

ring Thine Oneness (La ilaha ill Allah) and praising Thee (uttering al-Hamdu Lillah) and begging of 

Thee. Be would say: What do they beg of Me? They would say: They beg of Thee the Paradise of Thi-

ne. He (God) would say: Have they seen My Paradise? They said: No, our Lord. He would say: (What 

it would be then) if they were to see Mine Paradise? They (the angels) said: They seek Thine protecti-

on. He (the Lord) would say: Against what do they seek protection of Mine? They (the angels) would

deaf or absent. Verily, you are calling One Who is All-Hearing (and) Near to you and is with you. 

Abu Musa told that he had been behind him (the Holy Prophet) and reciting:" There is neither might 

nor power but that of Allah." He (the Holy Prophet), while addressing 'Abdullah b. Qais, said: Should I 

not direct you to a treasure from amongst the treasurers of Para- dise? I ('Abdullah b. Qais) said: Al-

where at its mouth there fell a rock of that mountain and thus blocked them altogether. One of them 

said to the others: Look to your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then suppli-

cate Allah, the Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble). One of them said: 0 Allah, I had 

my parents who were old and my wife and my small children also. I tended the flock and when I 

came back to them in the evening, I milked them (the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first served that 

milk to my parents. One day I was obliged to go out to a distant place in search of fodder and I could 

not come back before evening and found them (the parents) asleep. I milked the animals as I used to 

milk and brought milk to them and stood by their heads avoiding to disturb them from sleep and I 

did not deem it advisable to serve milk to my children before serving them. My children wept near 

my feet. I remained there in that very state and my parents too until it was morning. And (0 Allah) if 

Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. 

(The rock slipped a bit) that they could see the sky. The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female cou-

sin whom I loved more than the men love the women. I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her; 

she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very great difficulty that I 

could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and when I was going to have a sexual 

intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah, fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) 

but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasu-

re, rid us from this trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I 

employed a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in 

the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds, and that gave a 

bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my possession). He came to me 

and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway 

this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not ma-

king a fun of you. You take the cows and the flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I

of a tree and was overcome by sleep and his camel ran away. As he got up he tried to see (the camel) 

standing upon a mound. but did not find it. He then got upon the other mound, but could not see 

anything. He then climbed upon the third mound but did not see anything until he came back to the 

place where he had been previously. And as he was sitting (in utter disappointment) there came to 

him the camel, till that (camel) placed its nosestring in his hand. Allah is more pleased with the rep-

entance of His servant than the person who found (his lost camel) in this very state. Simak reported

mel loaded with the provisions of food and drink is lost and that moves about with its nosestring 

trailing upon the waterless desert in which there is neither food nor drink, and lie wanders about in 

search of that until he is completely exhausted and then accidentally it happens to pass by the trunk 

of a tree and its nosestring gets entangled in that and he finds it entangled therein? He (in response 

to the question of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah's Messenger, he would feel highly delighted. Thereu-

from Hell), and if a non-believer were to know what is there with Allah as a mercy. none would 

have been disappointed in regard to Paradise.

Book 037, Number 6637: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that a person who 

had never done any good deed asked the members of his family to burn his dead body when he 

would die and to scatter half of its ashes over the land and half in the ocean. By Allah, if Allah finds 

him   in   His   grip,   He   would   torment   him  with   a   torment   with   which   He   did   not   afflict   anyone 

amongst the people of the world; and when the person died, it was done to him as he had comman-

ded (his family) to do. Allah commanded the land to collect (the ashes scattered on it) and He com-

manded the ocean and that collected (ashes) contained in it. Allah questioned him why he had done. 

that He said: My Lord, it is out of Thine fear that I have done it and Thou art well aware of it, and Al-

lah granted him pardon:.

Book 037, Number 6638: 

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that a person com-

mitted sin beyond measure and when he was going to die, he left this will: (When I die), bum my 

dead body and then cast them (the ashes) to the wind and in the ocean. By Allah, if my Lord takes 

hold of me, He would torment me as He has not tormented anyone else. They did as he had asked 

them to do. He (the Lord) said to the earth: Return what you have taken. And he was thus restored to 

his (original form). He (Allah) said to him: What prompted you to do this? He said: My Lord, it was 

Thine fear or Thine awe, and Allah pardoned him because of this. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) as saying that a woman was thrown into Hell-Fire because of a cat 

whom she had tied and did not provide it with food. nor did she set it free to cat insects of the euth 

until it died inch by inch. Zuhri said: (These two ahidith) show that a person rhould neither feel con-

fident (of getting into Paradise) because of his deeds, nor should he lose (all hopes) of getting into Pa-

radise.

he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for

go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship 

along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went 

away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute 

between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has 

come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good

He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer 

to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of

Syria and those of Rome. Ibn Shihab (further) reported that 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abdullah b. Ka'b in-

formed him that Abdullah b. Ka'b who served as the guide of Ka'b b. 'Malik as he became blind that 

he heard Ka'b b. Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka'b b. Malik said: I never remained behind Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and 

that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining 

behind as Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack 

but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their ene-

mies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) on the night of 'Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to 

me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as 

compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and 

(my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had ne-

ver before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land 

(which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he in-

formed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately 

equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. 

And the Muslims who accompanied Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) at that time were 

large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka'b (further) said: Few were the persons 

who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal 

themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (de-

scended in connection with them).

And Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition when the fruits were 

ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season 

that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) made preparations and the Muslims too along with 

them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came 

back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I 

like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it 

was in the morning that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out and the Muslims too 

along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made 

no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of di-

stance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but per-

haps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people 

who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their inca-

pacity and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) took no notice of me until he had reached 

Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka'b

b. Malik? A person from Banu' Salama said: Allah's Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his ap-

preciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua'dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon 

that what you contend. Allah's Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy 

Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage).

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it 

was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa' of dates and was scoffed 

at by the hypocrites. Ka'b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fa-

bricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following 

day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my fa-

mily and when it was said to me that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to ar-

rive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could 

save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back 

from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak'ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of 

gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him be-

gan to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty per-

sons. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) accepted their excuses on the very face of them 

and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Al-

lah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in 

that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. 

He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah's Messen-

ger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I 

would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the 

knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put for-

ward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, 

and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well 

and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never 

had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expediti-

on).

Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This man told the truth, so get up 

until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu' Salama followed me in 

hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to 

this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough 

for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have sought 

forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also

met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they 

have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their 

case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi'a 'Amiri 

and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had 

participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they 

named these two persons. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the Nluslims to talk 

with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avo-

id us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere 

had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware 

and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two 

friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I 

was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, 

moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

red in response to my greetings (or not).

Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to 

my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And 

when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I 

walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had 

the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to 

him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn't you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by 

Allah. arn't you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down 

from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans 

of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka'b b. Malik. 

People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter 

of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:" Coming to 

my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty 

and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find 

your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: 

This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) to me and said: Verily, Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or 

what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don't have sexual con-

tact with her.

The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents 

and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came 

to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a se-

nile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don't go near 

him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from 

that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to 

the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him), for I cannot say what Allah's Apostle may say in response to seeking my 

permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus 

fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fif-

tieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I 

was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in 

these words:" Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness," 

that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal' saying at the top of his voice: 

Ka'b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there 

was (a message of) relief for me. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed the peo-

ple of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went 

on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings 

and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more 

quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I 

took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Al-

lah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one 

to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them.

I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on my way I met groups of people who 

greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for 

your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. 'Ubaidullah got 

up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person 

stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka'b said that he never forgot (this 

good gesture of) Talha. Ka'b further said: I greeted Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) with 

Assalam-o-'Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad ti-

dings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find 

today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah's Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance 

from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it loo-

ked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before 

him, I said: Allah's Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah's sake and for the 

sake of His Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

him) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part 

(of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah's 

Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that rep-

entance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not 

know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of 

telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Al-

lah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed 

these verses:"

Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who follo-

wed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He 

turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to 

the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their 

souls were also straitened to them." And this revelation reached up to the (words):" O you who belie-

ve, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful" (ix. 117-118). Ka'b said: By Allah, since Al-

lah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine 

which I spoke to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and if I were to tell a lie I would have 

been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used hars-

hest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):" They will swe-

ar by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. 

Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear 

to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not 

pleased with the transgressing people" (ix. 95-96). K'ab said that the matter of us three persons was 

deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not 

give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our 

case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur'an)" the three who were left behind" do not 

mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who 

took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri 

with the same chain of transmitters.

Book 037, Number 6671: 

'Abdullah b. K'ab, who was his (Ka'b's) guide as he became blind, reported that he heard from Ka'b 

b. Malik the story of his staying behind Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) from the expedi-

tion of Tabuk. The rest of the hadith is the same (but with this variation) that in the narration trans-

mitted on the authority of Yunus (the words are): When Allah's Messenger (may. peace be upon him) 

intended to set on an expedition he kept It as a secret, but. be did not do so in thic. expedition. And in 

the narration transmitted on the authority of Muhammad b. Abdullah b. Muslim, there is no mention 

1657 / 1800

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

of Abu Khaithana (Allah be pleased with him) and no mention of his meeting with Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him).

Book 037, Number 6672: 

It is reported on the authority of Abdullah b. K'ab and he was the guide of Ka'b as he lost his eye-

sight and he was the greatest scholar amongst his people and he retained in his mind many ahadith 

of the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: I heard my father Ka'b b. 

Malik, and he fas one of those three whose repentance was accepted (by Allah). He transmitted that 

He never lagged behind Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition that he 

undertook except two expeditions; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the tradition narrated 

through another chain of transmitters the words are:" That Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) set out on an expedition with a large number of persons more than ten thousand and this could 

not be recorded in the census register."

Chapter 10: Hadith pertaining to the lie about (hadrat) 

'A'isha Siddiqa (Allah be pleased with her) and ac-

cepting of repentance of those who brought false 

allegation about her 

Book 037, Number 6673: 

Sa'id b. Musayyib, 'Urwa b. Zubair, 'Alqama b. Waqqas and 'Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. 'Utba b. 

Mas'ud--all of them  reported the story of the  false allegation against 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah 

exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who 

had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (liste-

ning) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The 

sumaried substance of the false allegation is this): 'A'isha said: Whenever Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one 

with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting 

out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been 

made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set 

out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah's Messenger 

1658 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

(may peace be upon him) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command 

for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after 

relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been 

made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and 

this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me 

upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those 

days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not 

perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. 

So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to 

my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call).

I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would 

come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu'attal 

Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking 

in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and 

recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he 

recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I co-

vered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word 

from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed 

tLe camel's foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until 

we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those 

who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, the 

great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating 

over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware 

of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell 

ill before this. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would coome and greet me with Assalam-

o-'Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. 

I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the 

daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. 'Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. 'Amir, 

the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. 'Abbad b. Muttalib. I 

and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head 

dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do 

you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what 

he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false 

allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated.

I went to my house and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me and he greeted 

me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? 

1659 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my 

mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should 

not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wi-

ves also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking 

about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I 

wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) called 'Ali ibn Abi 'Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their 

advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Al-

lah's Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about thembut goodness. And as for 

'Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wi-

ves). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell 

you the truth. So, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you 

see anything in 'A'isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the 

truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she 

goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and 

he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in 

regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the 

people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, 

and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa'd b. Mu'adh stood up and said: Allah's 

Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his 

neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with 

your order.

Then Sa'd b. 'Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but 

he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa'd b. Mu'adh: By the everlasting exis-

tence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the 

power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa'd b. Mu'adh 

and said to Sa'd b. 'Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We 

would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the 

tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. 

'A'isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a 

wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break 

my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I 

permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with 

1660 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Mu-

hammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, 'A'isha, this is what has reached me 

about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally 

there has been a lapse on your part sock forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant 

makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) ac-

cepting his repentance.

When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single 

drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I 

should say to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what 

I should say to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I was a small girl at that time and I had 

not read much of the Qur'an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it 

has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite in-

nocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess 

to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not 

committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no 

other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) co-

mely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye descri-

be" (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was ful-

ly aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu 

(Qur'anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and 

Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision 

give an indication of my innocence to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) during his sleep. 

And, by Allah, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not moved an inch from where he 

had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glo-

rious, descended revelation upon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) there and then and he 

felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire becau-

se of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and 

there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, 

the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me 

were that he said: 'A'isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and 

my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: 

By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my 

honour. She ('A'isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:" 'Verily, those who spread the 

slander are a gang among you" (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further 

said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his po-

verty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. 'A'isha said: It was 

1661 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:" And let not those who possess di-

gnity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin" up to" Yearn ye not that Allah may 

forgive you?" Hibban b. Musa' said that 'Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in 

the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope.

Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he 

continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. 'A'isha said that Allah's Messenger (way 

peace be upon him) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon 

him), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah's Messenger, I shall 

not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in 

her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst 

the wives of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in 

bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, 

however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.

Book 037, Number 6674: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri through other chains of transmitters but 

with a slight variation of wording. In the hadith transmitters on the authority of 'Urwa, there is an 

addition of these words:" 'A'isha did not like that Hassan should be rebuked in her presence and she 

used to say: It was he who wrote this verse also:" 'Verily, my father and my mother and my honour, 

those are all meant for defending the honour of Muhammad against you." And 'Urwa further repor-

ted that 'A'isha said: By Allah, the person, about whom the allegation was trade used to say: Hallowed 

be Allah, by One, in Whose hand is my life, I have never unveiled any woman, and then he die, & as 

a martyr in the cause of Allah, and in the narration transmitted on the authority of Ya'qub b. Ibra-

him., the word is Mu'irin and in the narration transmitted on the'authority of 'Abd al-Razzaq it is 

Mughirin. 'Abd b. Humaid said: I said to 'Abd al-Razzaq: What does this word Mughirin mean? And 

he said: Al- waghra means intense heat.

Book 037, Number 6675: 

'A'Isha reported: When I came under discussion what the people had to say about me, Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) stood up for delivering an address and he recited tashahhud (I bear 

witness to the fact that iheie is no god but Allah) and praised Allah, lauded Him what He rightly de-

serves and then said: Coming to the point. Give me an advice about them who have brought false 

charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in 

connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never 

entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even 

in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in 

her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of 

1662 / 1800

SAHIH MUSLIM

BOOK 37: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO REPENTANCE AND EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE (KITAB AL-TAUBA)

the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, 

I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news rea-

ched the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By 

Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. 'A'isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and 

there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them 

were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite 'Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he 

was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind. And he was in fact 

a fabricator and there was Hamna, daughter of Jahsh with him.

Chapter 11: The exoneration of the slavegirl of Allah's 

apostle (may peace be upon him) from a false char-

ge 

Book 037, Number 6676: 

Anas reported that a person was charged with fornication with the slavegirl of Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to 'Ali: Go 

and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to 

him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ 

had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.

MUNAFIQIN WA AHKAMIHIM)

Chapter 1: 

Book 038, Number 6677: 

Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) in which we faced many hardships. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give 

what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu 

(from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case 

when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I 

came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone 

to 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact 

that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed at-

testing my truth:" When the hypocrites come" (lxiii. 1). Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) then 

called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were 

hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.

Book 038, Number 6678: 

Jabir reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, 

brought him out from that, placed him on his knee and put his saliva in his mouth and shrouded 

him in his own shirt and Allah knows best.

Book 038, Number 6679: 

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to the grave of 

'Abdullah b. Ubayy as he was placed in that. The rest of the hadith is the same.

Book 038, Number 6680: 

Ibn 'Umar reported that when 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul died. His son 'Abdullah b. 'Abdullah (b. 

Ubayy) came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him 

his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he 

should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got 

up to observe the prayer for him that 'Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for 

this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah's Messenger

SAHIH MUSLIM BOOK 38: PERTAINING TO THE CHARATERISTICS OF THE HYPOCRITES AND COMMAND CONCERNING THEM (KITAB SIFAT AL-

MUNAFIQIN WA AHKAMIHIM)

(may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:" You may beg pardon for 

them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times" (ix. 

80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this 

verse:" Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering 

prayer over them)" (ix. 84).

Book 038, Number 6681: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah with the same chain of transmitters 

but with this addition:" He then abandoned offering (funeral) prayer for them."

Book 038, Number 6682: 

Ibn Mas'ud reported that there gathered near the House three persons amongst whom two were 

Quraishi and one was a Thaqafi or two were Thaqafis and one was a Quraishi. They lacked under-

standing but wore more flesh. One of them said: Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The 

other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in under-

tones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak 

in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" You did not conceal yourselves 

lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you" (xli. 22).

Book 038, Number 6683: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah through another chain of transmitters.

Book 038, Number 6684: 

Zaid b. Thabit reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) set out for Uhud. Some of 

those persons who were with them came back. The Companions of Allah's Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) were divided in two groups. One group said: We would kill them, and the other one said: 

No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" Why should 

you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?" (iv. 88).

Book 038, Number 6685: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.

MUNAFIQIN WA AHKAMIHIM)

Book 038, Number 6686: 

Abu Sa'id Khudri reported that during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

the hypocrites behaved in this way that when Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) set out for a 

battle, they kept themselves behind, and they became happy that they had managed to sit in the hou-

se contrary to (the act of) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and when Allah's Apostle 

(may peace he upon him) came back, they put forward excuses and took oath and wished that peo-

ple should laud them for the deeds which they had not done. It was on this occasion that this verse 

was revealed:" Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for 

what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful 

chastisement" (iii. 18).

Book 038, Number 6687: 

Humaid b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported that Marwan said to Rafi', his chamberlain, that he 

should go to Ibn 'Abbas and ask him: If every one of us be punished for his being happy upon his 

deed and for his being praised for what he has not done, nobody would be saved from the torment. 

Ibn 'Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with 

the people of the Book." Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:" When Allah took a covenant from those 

who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this" (iii. 186), and 

then Ibn 'Abbas recited this verse:" Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to 

be praised for what they have not done" (iii. 186). Ibn 'Abbas (further) said: Allah's Apostle (may pe-

ace be upon him) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him so-

mething else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them 

and they felt happy of what they had concealed.

Book 038, Number 6688: 

Qais reported: I said to 'Ammar: What is your opinion about that which you have done in case (of 

your siding with Hadrat 'Ali)? Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him)? 'Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah's Apostle (may 

peace be upon him) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hy-

pocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through 

the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do 

not remember what Shu'ba said about them.

MUNAFIQIN WA AHKAMIHIM)

Book 038, Number 6689: 

Qais b. 'Ubad reported: We said to 'Ammar: Was your fighting (on the side of 'Ali in the Battle of 

Siffin) a matter of your own choice or you got its hints from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) for it, is likely for one to err in one's own discretion or was it because of any covenant that Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from you? He said: It was not because of any covenant 

that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from us which he did get from other people, 

and he further said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:" In my Ummah." And I 

think that Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my 

Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise and they 

would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle's hole. Dubaila (ulcer) would 

be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it 

would protrude from their chest.

Book 038, Number 6690: 

Abu Tufail reported that there was a dispute between Hudhaifa and one from the people of Aqaba 

as it happens amongst people. He said: I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from 

Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been infor-

med that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen 

and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the 

announcement of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we were not aware of the intenti-

on of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then 

said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he 

found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.

Book 038, Number 6691: 

Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who climbed 

this hill, the hill of Murar, his sins would be obliterated as were obliterated the sins of Bani Isra'il. So 

the first to take their horses were the people of Banu Khazraj. Then there was a ceaseless flow of per-

sons and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: All of you are those who have 

been pardoned except the owner of a red camel. We came to him and said to him: You also come on, 

so that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) may seek forgiveness for you. But he said: By Al-

lah, so far as I am concerned, the finding of something lost is dearer to me than seeking of forgiven-

ess for me by your companion (the Holy Prophet), and he remained busy in finding out his lost thing.

MUNAFIQIN WA AHKAMIHIM)

Book 038, Number 6692: 

Jabir b. Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who would 

climb this hill of Murar. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that it was a desert 

Arab who was finding out his lost thing.

Book 038, Number 6693: 

Anas b. Malik reported: There was a person amongst us who belonged to the tribe of Bani Najjar 

and he recited Sura al-Baqarah and Surat Al-i-'Imran and he used to transcribe for Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him). He ran away as a rebel and joined the People of the Book. They gave it 

much importance and said: He is the person who used to transcribe for Muhammad and they were 

much pleased with him. Time rolled on that Allah caused his death. They dug the grave and buried 

him therein, but they found to their surprise that the earth had thrown him out over the surface. 

They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the sur-

face. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the 

surface. At last they left him unburied.

Book 038, Number 6694: 

Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back from a journey and as 

he was near Medina, there was such a violent gale that the mountain seemed to be pressed. Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This wind has perhaps been made to blow for the death of 

a hypocrite, and as he reached Medina a notorious hypocrite from amongst the hypocrites had died.

Book 038, Number 6695: 

Iyas reported on the authority of his father: We went along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) to visit a person suffering from fever. When I placed my hand upon him, I said: By Allah, 

I have never seen, till this day, a person running higher temperature than he. Thereupon Allah's 

Apostle (may peace be upon him), turning his face to his companions, said: May I not inform you of a 

severer temperature than this which these two persons would run on the Day of Resurrection? And 

they were two hypocrites riding upon the camel turning their back towards (the Muslims).

Book 038, Number 6696: 

Ibn Umar reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of a hypo-

crite is that of a sheep which roams aimlessly between two flocks. She goes to one at one time and to 

the other at another time.

Heavens on the Day of Judgment upon one finger and earths upon one finger and the mountains and 

trees upor one finger and the ocean and moist earth upon one finger-in fact the whole of the creati-

on upon one finger, and then He would stir them and say: I am your Lord, I am your Lord. Thereu-

pon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled testifying what that scholar had said. He 

then recited this verse:" And they honour not Allah with the honour due to Him; and the whole earth 

will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heaven* r*Utd up in His right hand. Glory be 

to Him I and highly Exalted is Re above what they associate (with Him)" (xxxix. 67).

Book 039, Number 6700: 

This hadlth has been narrated on the authority of Mansur with the same chain of truemittm (and 

the words are): A Jew scholar came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). The rest of the 

hadith is the same, but there is no mention of" then He would stir them." But there is this addition:" I 

saw Allah's Messengcr (may peace be upon him) smiling so much that his front teeth appeared and 

testifying him (th Jew scholar) ; then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited the verse:"

open them (and say): I am your Lord. I saw the pulpit in commotion from underneath because of so-

course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be

May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said:

Jews happened to meet him. Some of them said to the others: Ask him about the Soul. They said: 

Wbat is your doubt about it? There is a possibility that you may ask him about anything (the answer 

of) which you may not like. They said: Ask him. So one amongst them asked him about the Soul. Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept quiet and he gave no reply and I came to know that 

revelation was being sent to him, so I stood at my place and thus this revelation descended upon 

him:" They ask thee 'about Soul. Say: The Soul is by the Commandment of my Lord, and of Knowledge 

you are given but a little" (xvii. 58).

Abu Huraira reported that Abu Jahl asked (people) whether Mubammad placed his face (on the 

ground) in their presence. It was said to him: Yes. He said: By Lit and Uzza. If I were to see him do 

that, I would trample his neck, or I would beamear his face with dust. He came to Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) as he was engaged in prayer and thought of trampling his neck (and the 

people say) that he came near him but turned upon his heels and tried to repulse something with his 

hands. It was said to him: What is the matter with you? He said: There is between me and him a ditch 

of fire and terror and wings. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: If he were 

to come near me the angels would have torn him to pieces. Then Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, re-

vealed this verse- (the narrator) said: We do not whether it is the hadith transmitted te Abu Huraira 

or something conveyed to him from another source:" Nay, man is surely inordinate, because he looks 

upon himself as self-sufficient. Surely to thy Lord is the return. Hast thou seen him who forbids a 

servant when he prays? Seest thou if he is on the right way, or enjoins observance of piety? Seest

We will seize him by the forelock-a lying, sinful forelock. Then let him summon his council. We will 

summon the guards of the Hell. Nay! Obey not thou him" (Icvi. 6-19). (Rather prostrate thyself.) 

Ubaidullah made this addition: It was after this that (prostration) was enjoined upon and Ibn Abd al-

Ala made this addition that by Nadia he meant his people.

Book 039, Number 6719: 

Masruq reported: We were sitting in the company of Abdullah and he was lying on the bed that a 

person came and said: Abd Abd al-Rabmin, a story-teller at the gates of Kinda says that the verse (of 

the Qur'an) which deals with the" smoke" implies that which is about to come and it would hold the 

breath of the infidels and would inflict the believers with cold. Thereupon Abdullah got up and said 

in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which 

he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best know-

ledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the 

best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon 

him) to state:" I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble," 

and when Allah's Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he 

said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted

with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and 

the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a 

smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah 

and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. 

Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:" Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke 

from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent" up to the words:" you 

are going to return to (evil)." (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastise-

ment of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur'an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the 

most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution" (xliv. 16)? The seizing (in the hadith) implies 

that of the Day of Badr. And so far as the sign of smoke, seizing, inevitability and signs of Rome are 

concern- ed, they have become things of the past now.

Book 039, Number 6720: 

Masruq reported that there came to Abdullah a person and said: I have left behind in the mosque 

a man who explains the Qur'an according to his personal discretion and he explained this verse:" So 

wait for the day when the Heaven brings a clear smoke." He says that a smoke would come to the 

people on the Day of Resurrection anl it will withhold breath and they would be inflicted with cold. 

'Abdullah said: He who has knowledge should say something and he who has no knowledge should 

simply say: Allah is best aware. This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about 

that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish diso-

beyed Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted 

with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a 

person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they 

were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah's Apostle 

(may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its 

people) have been undone. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: For Mudar? You are over-

bold, but he supplicated Allah for them. It was upon this that this verse was revealed:" We shall re-

move the chastisement a little, but they will surely return to evil" (xliv. 15). lie (the narrator) said: 

There was a downpoor of rain upon them. When there was some relief for them they returned to the 

same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" So 

wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people. This is a grievous torment 

on the day when We seize them with the most violent seizing; surely, We shall exact retribution." 

And this (seizing) implied (Battle) of Badr.

the date-palm tree, but I felt hesitant (to say that). They (the Companions) then said: Allah's Messen-

ger, (kindly) tell us which that can be? Thereupon he said: It is the date-palm tree. I made a mention

rein that it implied the date- palm tree. I made up my mind to make a mention of that but could not

nothing hindered me to come out to you but the fact that I did not like to bore you (by stuffing your 

minds with sermons) as Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not deliver us sermon on 

certain days fearing that it might prove to be boring for us.

mon one day, said: Behold, my Lord commanded me that I should teach you which you do not know 

and which He has taught me today. (He has instructed thus): The property which I have conferred 

upon them is lawful for them. I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the 

worship of Allah but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful 

what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Re, alt-

hough he has no justification for that. And verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and 

He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, but with the exception of some remnants from 

the People of the Book. And He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you 

to test and put (those to test) through you. And I sent the Book to you which cannot be washed away 

by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep. Verily, Allah comman-

ded me to burn (kill) the Quraish. I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of 

bread, and Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We 

shall help you in this, you should spend and you would be conferred upon. You send an army and I 

would send an army five times greater than that. Fight against those who disobey you along with 

those who obey you. The inmates of Paradise are three: One who wields authority and is just and fair, 

one who Is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds. And the person who is 

merciful and kind hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and one who does not 

stretch his hand in spite of having a large family to support. And He said: The inmates of Hell are 

five: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of 

the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth. And

who betray you. morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property. He also made a

pride upon the others, And it does not behove one to do so, and He also said: There are among you 

people to follow not caring a bit for their family and property. Qatada said: Abu Abdullah, would this

upon him) was going along with us towards the dwellings of Bani an-Najjar, riding upon his pony, it 

shied and he was about to fall. He found four, five or six graves there. He said: Who amongst you 

knows about those lying in the graves? A person said: It is I. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: In 

what state did they die? He said: They died as polytheists. He said: These people are passing through 

the ordeal in the graves. If it were not the reason that you would stop burying (your dead) in the 

graves on listening to the torment in the grave which I am listening to, I would have certainly made 

you hear that. Then turning his face towards us, he said: Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of 

Hell. They said: We seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell. He said: Seek refuge with Allah 

from the torment of the grave. They said: We seek refuge with Allali from the torment of the grave. 

He said: Seek refuge with Allah from turmoil, its visible and invisible (aspects), and they said: We 

seek refuge with Allah from turmoil and its visible and invisible aspects and he said: Seek refuge 

with Allah from the turmoil of the Dajjal, and they said We seek refuge with Allah from the turmoil 

of the Dajjal.

mes the pious soul from the side of the earth Let there be blessings of Allah upon the body in which it 

resides. And it is carried (by the angels) to its Lord, the Exalted and Glorious. He would say: Take it to 

its destined end. And if he is a nonbeliever and as it (the soul) leaves the body-Hammad made a

from the side of the earth, and it would be said: Take it to its destined end. Abu Huraira reported that

would soon be able to see it (when it will shine more brightly). I lay upon bed. He then made a men-

tion of the people of Badr to us and said: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) showed us one 

day before (the actual battle) the place of death of the people (participating) in (the Battle) of Badr

By Him Who sent him with truth, they did not miss the places (of their death) which Allah's Messen-

ger (may peace be upon him) had pointed for them. Then they were all thrown in a well one after

Book 041, Number 6881: 

Zainab bint Jahsh reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) got up from sleep saying: 

There is no god but Allah; there is a destruction in store for Arabia because of turmoil which is at 

hand, the barrier of Gog and Magog has opened so much. And Sufyan made a sign of ten with the 

help of his hand (in order to indicate the width of the gap) and I said: Allah's Messenger, would we 

be perished in spite of the fact that there would be good people amongst us? Thereupon he said: Of 

course, but only when the evil predominates.

Book 041, Number 6882: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zainab bint Jahsh with a slight variation in the

Zainab bint Jahsh, the wife of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported that one day Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out in a state of excitement with his face quite red. 

And he was saying: There is no god but Allah; there is a destruction in store for Arabia beciuse of the 

turmoil which is near at hand as the barrier of Gog and Magog has been opened like it, and he (in 

order to explain it) made a ring with the help o his thumb and forefinger. I said: Allah's Messenger, 

would we be destroyed despite the fact that there would be pious people amongst us? He said: Yes, 

when the evil would predominate.

Chapter 2: The sinking of an army in the earth which 

would attack the house 

Book 041, Number 6886: 

Harith b Abi Rabi'a and 'Abdullah b. Safwan both went to Umm Salama, the Mother of the Faithful, 

and they asked her about the army which would be sunk in the earth, and this relates to the time 

when Ibn Zubair (was the governor of Mecca). She reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army 

would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be 

made to sink. I said: Allah's Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army 

willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them buf he would be raised on 

the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention. Abu Ja'far said. ' This plain, ground means the 

plain ground of Medina.

Book 041, Number 6887: 

This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Rufai, with the same chain of trans-

mitters (but with the addition of these words):" When I met Abu Ja'far I told him that she (simply) 

meant the plain ground. Thereupon Abu Ja'far said: No, by God, she meant the plain ground of Me-

dina.

Book 041, Number 6888: 

Abdullah b. Safwan reported that Hafsa told him that she had heard Allah's Apostle (may peace be 

upon him) as saying: An army would attack this House in order to fight against the inhabitants of 

this House and when it would be at the plain ground the ranks in the centre of the army would be 

sunk and the vanguard would call the rear flanks of the army and they would also be sunk and no 

flank would be left except some people who would go to inform them (their kith and kin). A person 

(who had been listening to this badith from Abdullah b. Safwan) said: I bear testimony in regard to 

you that you are not imputing a lie to Hafsa. And I bear testimony to the fact that Hafsa is not telling 

a lie about Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him).

Book 041, Number 6889: 

Abdullah b. Safwan reported the Mother of the Faithful as saying that Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) said: They would soon seek protection in this House, viz. Ka'ba (the defenceless), 

people who would have nothing to protect themselves in the shape of weapons or the strength of the

people. An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground 

the army would be sunk in it. Yiisuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of 

Hajjaj) who had been on that day comin. towards Mecca for an attack (on 'Abdulllah b. Zubair) and 

Abdullah b. Safwan said: By God, it does not imply this army.

Book 041, Number 6890: 

'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was startled in the state of sleep. 

We said: Allah's Messenger, you have done something in the state of your sleep which you never did 

before, Thereupon he said: Strange it is that some, people of my Ummah would attack the House 

(Ka'ba) (for killing) a person who would belong to the tribe of the Quraish and he would try to seek 

protection in the House. And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: 

Allah's   Messenger,   all   sorts   of   people   throng   the   path.  Thereupon   he   said:   Yes,   there  would   be 

amongst them people who would come with definite designs and those who would come under 

duress and there would be travellers also, but they would all be destroyed through one (stroke) of 

destruction.  though   they   would  be  raised  in   different  states  (on  the Day  of Resurrection).  Allah 

would, however, raise them according to their intention.

Chapter 3: The turmoil would come like rainfall 

Book 041, Number 6891: 

Usama   reported   that   Allah's   Messenger   (may   peace   be   upon   him)   climbed   up   a   battlement 

amongst the battlements of Medina and then said: You do not see what I am seeing and I am seeing 

the places of turmoil between your houses as tile places of rainfall.

period of turmoil in which the one who sits will be better than one who stands and the one who 

stands will be better than one who walks and the one who walks will be better than one who runs. 

He who would watch them will be drawn by them. So he who finds a refuge or shelter against it 

should make it as his resort.

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would be turmoil 

and the one who would sleep would be better than who would be awake and the one who would be 

awake would be better than one who would stand and one who would stand would be better than 

one who would run. So he who finds refuge or shelter should take that refuge or shelter.

Book 041, Number 6896: 

Abu Bakra reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would soon be 

turmoil. Behold! there would be turmoil in which the one who would be seated would be better than 

one who would stand and the one who would stand would be better than one who would run. Be-

hold! when the turmoil comes or it appears, the one who has camel should stick to his camel and he 

who has sheep or goat should stick to his sheep and goat and he who has land should stick to the 

land. A person said: 'Allah's Messenger, what is your opinion about one who has neither camel nor 

sheep nor land? Thereupon, he said: He should take hold of his sword and beat its edge with the help 

of stone and then try to find a way of escape. O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message) ; O Allah, I 

have conveyed (Thy Message) ; O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message). A person said: Allah's Mes-

senger, what is your opinion it I am drawn to a rank in spite of myself, or in one of the groups and 

made to march and a man strikes with his sword or there comes an arrow and kills me? Thereupon 

he said: He will bear the punishment of his sin and that of yours and he would be one amongst the 

denizens of Hell.

Bakra met me. He said: Ahnaf, where do you intend to go? I said: I intend to help the cousin of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him), viz. 'Ali. Thereupon he said to me: Ahnaf, go back, for I heard 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When two Muslims confront one another 

with swords (in hands) both the slayer and the slain would be in Fire. He (Ahnaf) said: I said, or it 

was said: Allah's Messenger, it may be the case of one who kills. but what about the slain (why he 

would be put in Hell-Fire)? Thereupon he said: He also intended to kill his companion.

the world near one another for my sake. And I have seen its eastern and western ends. And the do-

minion of my Unimah would reach those ends which have been drawn near me and I have been 

granted the red and the white treasure and I begged my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be 

destroyed because of famine, nor be dominated by an enemy who is not amongst them to take their 

lives and destroy them root and branch, and my Lord said: Muhammad, whenever I make a decision, 

there is none to change it. Well, I grant you for your Ummah that it would not be destroyed by fami-

ne and it would not be dominated by an enemy who would not be amongst it and would take their 

lives and destroy them root and branch even if all the people from the different parts of the world 

join hands together (for this purpose), but it would be from amongst them, viz. your Ummah, that 

some people would kill the others or imprison the others.

turmoil which is going to appear in the period intervening me and the Last Hour; and it is not for the 

fact that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) told me something confidentially pertaining to 

it and he did not tell anybody else about it, but it is because of the fact that I was present in the as-

sembly in which he had been describing the turmoil. and he especially made a mention of three tur-

moils which would not spare anything and amongst these there would be turmoils like storms in the 

hot season. Some of them would be violent and some of them would be comparatively mild. Hudhai-

fa said: All (who were present) except I have gone (to the next world).

Hudhaifa reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood before us one day and 

he did not leave anything unsaid (that he had to say) at that very spot which would happen (in the

minds and those who could not remember them forgot them. My friends knew them and there are

addressed us until it was time for the 'Asr prayer. He then again came down and observed the prayer

preserved in his mind most perfectly the hadith of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in re-

gard to the turmoil as he told about it? I said: It is I. Thereupon he said: You are bold (enough to 

make this claim). And he further said: How? I said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) as saying: There would (first) be turmoil for a person in regard to his family, his property, his 

own self, his children, his neighbours (and the sins comnaitted in their connection) would be expia-

ted by fasting, prayer, charity, enjoining good and prohibiting evil. Thereupon 'Umar said: I do not 

mean (that turmoil on a small scale) but that one which would eme-ge like the mounting waves of 

the ocean. I said: Commander of the Faithful, you have nothing to do with it, for the door is closed 

between you and that. He said: Would that door be broken or opened? I said: No, it would be broken. 

Thereupon he said: Then it would not be closed despite best efforts. We said to Hudhaifa: Did Umar

lah, they would not do it, and I have heard a hadith of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

which I am narrating to you in this connection. I said: You are a bad seat fellow. I have been oppo-

sing you since morning and you are listening to me in spite of the fact that you have heard a hadith 

from Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) (contrary to ray statement). I myself felt that there was

not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (sol-

diers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them). When they 

will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Mus-

lims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, 

by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They 

will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A 

third (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be 

killed ani the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of 

Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) af-

ter hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place 

among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would 

come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing 

up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of 

Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it 

would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them 

at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would 

show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).

the people divide in- heritance and rejoice over booty, and then said pointing towards Syria, with the 

gesture of his hand like this: The enemy shall muster strength against Muslims and the Muslims will 

muster strength against them (Syrians). I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be 

a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would 

not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return 

without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment

a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that 

the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, 

so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the 

end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) 

one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the 

spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they 

would hear of a calamity more horrible than this. And a cry would reach them: The Dajjil has taken

They were dressed in woollen clothes and they stood near a hillock and they met him as Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) was sitting. I said to myself: Better go to them and stand between 

him and them that they may not attack him. Then I thought that perhaps there had been going on 

secret negotiation amongst them. I however, went to them and btood between them and him and I 

remember four of the words (on that occasion) which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand) that he 

(Allah's Messenger) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you 

would attack Persia and He would make you to Conquer it. Then you would attack Rome and AllgLh

have children. Have you not heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He would 

not enter Mecca and Medina? I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said I have been once in Medina

of birth his abode where he is just now. He (Abu Sa'id) said: This caused confusion in my mind (in

Abu Sa'id Khudri reported: Ibn Sa'id said to me somethhing for which I felt ashamed. He said: I can 

excuse others; but what has gone wrong with you, O Companions of Muhammad, that you take me 

as Dajjal? Has Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) not said that he would be a Jew whereas I am 

a Muslim and he also said that he would not have children, whereas I have children, and he also 

said: veryly, Allah has prohibited him to enter Mecca whereas I have performed Pilgrimage, atid. he 

went on saying this that I was about to be impressed by his tallk. He (however) said this also: I know 

where he (Dajjal) is and I know his father abd I mother, and it was said to him: Won't you feel plea-

Sa'id was along with us. And w, e encamped at a place and the people dispersed and I and he were 

left behind. I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He 

brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place 

that under that tree? And he did that. Then ther appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and 

brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Sa'id, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot 

(whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to opr to take it from his hand 

and he said: Abu Sa'id, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then coimmit 

sucide because of the talks of the people, and he furtlier said. Abu Sa'id he who is ingnoran of the 

saying of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (he is to be pardoned), but O people of Ansar, 

is this hadith of Allah's Messengern (may peace be upon him) concealed from you whereas you have

Did Allalt's Messenger (may peace be upon him) not say that he (Dajjal) would be a non believer 

whereas I am a believer? did Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) not say he would be barren 

and no child would be born to hirn, whereas I have left my children in Medina? Did Allh's Messen-

ger (may peace upon him) not say: He would not get into Medina and Mecca whereas I have been 

coming from Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca? Abu Sa'id said: I was about to accept the ex-

near the bettlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adole-

scence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah's Messenger (may peace be

Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and 

he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of 

Allah? Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah 

and in His messengers. Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: What do you 

see? Ibn Sayyad said: It us a Dukh. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May 

you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. 'Umar b. 

Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Therupon Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you 

would not be able to overpower him, and he is not that ther is no good for you to kill him. 'Abdullah

the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn 

Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If she had left 

him alone he would have made things clear. Abdullah b. Umar told that Allah's Messenger (may pe-

mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his 

people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which 

no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted 

and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: 'Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of 

the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) informed him that the day when Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There 

would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his

us. I then departed and met him again for the second time and his eye had been swollen. I said: What 

has happened to your eye? He said: I do not know. I said: This is in your head and you do not know 

about it? He said: If Allah so wills He can create it (eye) in your staff. He then produced a sound like 

the braying of a donkey. Some of my companions thought that I had struck him with the staff as he 

was with me that the staff broke into pieces, but, by Allah, I was not conscious of it. He then came to 

the Mother of the Faithful (Hafsa) and narrated it to her and she said: What concern you have with

An-Nawwas b. Sam'an reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) made a mention 

of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes 

described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm 

trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in 

our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah's Messenger, you made a mention of 

the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very im-

portant, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the dat-

palm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the 

Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he co-

mes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take 

care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a 

young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to 'Abd-ul-'Uzza b. Qatan. 

He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura 

Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right 

and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah's Messenger, how long 

would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and 

one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah's Messenger, 

would one day's prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but 

you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah's Messenger, how 

quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would 

come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him 

and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the 

earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them 

with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then 

come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from 

them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of we-

alth.

He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the tre-

asures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then 

call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and

then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happi-

ness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at 

the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron 

and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall 

beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter 

from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would 

reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch 

hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would 

come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in 

Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have 

brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; 

you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would 

swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. 

And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his com-

panions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the 

head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his 

companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their 

necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his 

companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space 

as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his 

companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like tho-

se of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.

Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels' hairs would keep out 

and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told 

to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) 

pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and 

milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch ca-

mel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that 

and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of 

that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under 

their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who 

would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.

dina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to 

him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I 

bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He 

would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, 

he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present 

time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he 

would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah

say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed 

(us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him 

and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would 

ask him: Don't you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to 

be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would 

walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would 

then say to him: Don't you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight 

concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave 

with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him 

so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into 

copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet 

and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire 

whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord 

of the world.

to do any harm to you. I said: Allah's Messenger, it is alleged that he would have along with him (ab-

undance of) food and water. Thereupon he said: He would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah 

(even) with all this.

mutton and rivers of water. Thereupon he said: He would be more insignificant in the eye of Allah

wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless 

as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. 

Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don't you respond? And they

other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting

that the Last Hour would come at such and such time, whereupon he said: I had made up my mind 

that I would not narrate anything to you. I only said: But you would soon see after some time a very 

significant affair, for example the burning of the House (Ka'ba). Shu'ba said like this and 'Abdullah b 

Amr reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: The Dajjal would appear in 

my Ummah. And in another hadith (the words are): None would survive who would have even a 

speck of faith in his heart, but he would be dead. Muhammad b. ja'far reported that Shu'ba narrated

Book 041, Number 7028: 

Amir b. Sharahil Sha'bi Sha'b Hamdan reported that he asked Fatima, daughter of Qais and sister 

of ad-Dahhak b. Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith 

which you had heard directly from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra 

link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: 

Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young 

man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst 

the group of the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of 

marriage. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed sla-

ve Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) 

had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may mar-

ry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and 

Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah 

and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for 

Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head 

may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight 

of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Umm 

Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to 

which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard 

the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mos-

que (where) congregational prayer (is observed).

So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every 

worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to as-

semble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you as-

semble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, 

who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about 

the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and 

Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them 

(near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and ente-

red that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distin-

guish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jas-

sasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is 

very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were 

afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and 

found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his 

two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon 

come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we em-

barked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near 

this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely 

thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. 

We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it 

said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. 

So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: 

Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek infor-

mation? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.

We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the 

lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? 

They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. 

He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to 

know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to 

him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the 

help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come 

out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We 

said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his 

neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it ac-

tually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should 

show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon per-

mitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I 

would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) 

for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his 

hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage

leading to it; then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the 

end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Da-

jjal) like this? 'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it 

corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold 

he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary,

pronounced as to how much time she should count as the waiting period. She said: My husband pro-

nounced three divorces in my case and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted me to 

spend any waiting period in my family. (It was during this period) that announcement was made for 

the people to observe prayer in the bigger Mosque. I went there along with people and I was in the 

front row meant for women and it was adjacent to the last row of men and I heard Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) deliver sermon sitting on the pulpit. He said: The cousin of Tamim (Dari) 

sailed in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition:" (I see) as if I am looking

island. They moved about in that land in search of water. There they saw a person who had been 

pulling his hair. The rest of the hadith is the same. And he (Dajjal) said: If I were to be permitted to 

set out I would have covered all the lands except Taiba. Then Allah's Messerger (may peace be upon 

him) brought (Tamim Dari) before the public and he narrated to them and said: That is Taiba and 

that is the Dajjal.

Fatima b. Qais reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sat on the pulpit and

to an island in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is the same.

Abu Huraira, narrated that he beard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There 

were three persons in Bani Isra'il, one suffering from leprosy, the other bald-headed and the third 

one blind. Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from 

leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal 

of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more 

and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which 

property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful 

about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The 

came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-

camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I 

Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful 

hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped

Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while han-

and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should 

be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight,

and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was 

given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley aboun-

ded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering 

from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run 

short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and 

your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the 

shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have 

many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not 

suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you 

(wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a 

liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who 

was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering 

from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you 'are a liar, may 

Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man 

in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have 

ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with 

your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock 

of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He 

said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whate-

ver you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. The-

reupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three 

were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.

Book 042, Number 7072: 

It is reported on the authority of Amir b. Sa'd that Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas was in the fold of his camels 

that his son 'Umar came to him. When Sa'd saw him he said: I seek refuge with Allah from the mi-

schief of this rider. And as he got down he said to him: You are busy with your camels and your 

sheep and you have abandoned people who are contending with one another for kingdom. Sa'd 

struck his chest and said: Keep quite. I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: 

Allah loves the servant who is God-conscious and is free from want and is hidden (from the view of 

people).

trees) and as a result thereof one amongst us would relieve himself as does the goat. (How strange it

se punishment upon me (in regard to it). If it is so (that I am so ignorant of religion), then indeed, I

'Umair al-'Adawi reported: 'Utba b. Ghazwan delivered us a sermon and he praised Allah and lau-

ded Him, then said: Now coming to the point, verily the world has been given the news of its end and 

that too quite early. Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner 

leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the 

good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it 

would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would 

be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a di-

stance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a 

day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh 

amongst seven who had been with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing 

to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which 

we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa'd b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of 

it and so did Sa'd make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who 

has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I 

seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of 

Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes 

eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would 

come after us and see (how far they are from religion).

Book 042, Number 7076: 

Khalid b. 'Umair reported and he had seen the pre-Islamic days also, that 'Uqba b. Ghazwan deli-

provide you the spouse and subdue for you horses, camels, and afforded you an opportunity to rule 

over your subjects? He would say: Yes. And then it would be said: Did you not think that you would

Us. Then the second person would be brought for judgment. (And Allah would) say: 0, so and so. did

Book 042, Number 7148: 

Suhaib reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) thus said: There lived a king be-

fore you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have 

grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a 

young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young 

man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was im-

pressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and 

he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of 

that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my fa-

mily had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had 

detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the 

people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or 

the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to 

Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to 

move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about 

(on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk 

said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you 

would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don't give my clue. That young man 

began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from 

(all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came 

to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be 

yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I 

shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.

He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as 

he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon 

he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he 

(the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was 

thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so 

much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do 

such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the 

king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus

summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to 

do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the 

middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was 

brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw 

was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was 

brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was han-

ded over to a group of his courtiers. And he 'said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; 

make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if 

he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up 

the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain 

began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to 

him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again 

handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you 

reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his re-

ligion throw him (into the water).

So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite 

soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the 

king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, 

and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is 

that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take 

hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an 

arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an 

open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his qui-

ver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young 

boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple whe-

re the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this 

young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this 

young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually 

done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the 

king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, 

and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy's) 

religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted 

death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jum-

ping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.

hadith of Jabir 

Book 042, Number 7149: 

'Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the 

Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was 

the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there 

was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle pre-

pared by the tribe of Ma'afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma'afiri mantle over him. My fa-

ther said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such 

and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, 

extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son 

who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he 

hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother's bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for 

I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He 

said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to 

you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah's 

Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do 

you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by 

Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note 

and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent 

enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine 

saw, and he (Abu'I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my 

heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his 

debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant 

and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma'afir and give him your cloak, then 

there would be one dress for you and one for him.

He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two 

very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and 

he pointed towards the heart that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the 

servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is 

easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we 

came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he 

had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the 

Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your 

body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just

BOOK 42: THE BOOK PERTAINING TO PIETY AND SOFTENING OF HEARTS (KITAB AL-ZUHD WA AL-RAQA'IQ)

like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought 

that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do 

like it. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his 

hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it 

with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should 

turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah 

should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Al-

lah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah's Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: 

If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not 

spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he 

is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in 

some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged 

to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had 

been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.

It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. 'Amr al-

Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we 

mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it 

kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he 

said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah's Messenger, it' is I. Thereupon he said: Get 

down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don't curse your own sel-

ves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies 

with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may 

be readily responded.

It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead

said: Allah's Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be

went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and 

then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

of it? We said: Yea, Allah's Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled 

its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at 

another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablu-

der to relieve himself and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and 

there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It 

had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my 

neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He 

caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. 

Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught 

hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After 

that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-

cloth. When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I 

said: Allah's Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then 

tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.

Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and 

the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used 

to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our 

mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We 

carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offe-

red that and he got up and received that.

Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to 

relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah's 

Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: 

Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel 

who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a 

twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, 

and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with 

the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) 

should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word" 

faitab'd" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its 

place. I saw Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head 

towards right and left. Isma'il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to 

demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: 

Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah's Messenger, yes. He then said: Then 

you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them 

where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig

on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came  

to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.

I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and 

said: Allah's Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he 

said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make 

intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain 

fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and per-

form wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in 

the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Messenger (may pe-

ace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such 

and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a 

glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to 

draw that, the water-skin's,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the 

mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring 

that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not 

understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the 

tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly 

and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fin-

gers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by re-

citing Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between 

the fingers of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was 

filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the ef-

fect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were 

all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah's Messenger (may peace be 

upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a com-

plaint to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide 

you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal 

and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart's content. Jabir said: I and 

such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and 

we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the per-

sons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it 

could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.

Book 042, Number 7150: 

Al-Bara' b. 'Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father ('Azib) and 

bought a haudaj from him and said to 'Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), 

and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu 

Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he ('Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me 

what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah's Messenger (may 

peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, 

and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a 

large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that 

place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy 

Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: 

Allah's Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around 

him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we in-

tended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He 

said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He 

said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from 

hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara' striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how 

he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a 

bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah's Apostle 

(may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled 

from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah's Messenger, take this 

milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to 

march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. 

Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah's Messenger, we are 

about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Al-

lah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he 

also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I 

shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah's Messenger) supplicated 

Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this 

side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.

Al-Bara' reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the ha-

dith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. 'Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew 

near Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his ca-

mel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully awa-

re of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitch-

forked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are co-

ming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at 

such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Pro-

phet) said: I don't need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina du-

ring the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to 'Abd ul-Muttalib 

from the side of mother. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people 

climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: 

Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.

Book 043, Number 7151: 

Hammim b. Munabbih reported: This is what Abu Huraira reported to us from Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) and in this connection he narrated some of the ahadith and Allah's Mes-

senger (may peace be upon him) said: It was said to people of Israel: Enter this land saying Hitta (Re-

move Thou from us the burden of our sins), whereupon We would forgive you your sins, but they 

twisted (this statement) and entered the gate dragging upon their breech and said: The" grain in the

Book 043, Number 7152: 

Anas b. Malik reported that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent revelation to Allah's Messenger 

(may peace be upon him) just before his death in quick succession until he left for his heavenly 

home, and the day when he died, he received the revelation profusely.

Book 043, Number 7153: 

Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew said to'Umar: You recite a verse which, if it had been revealed 

in relation to us, we would have taken that day as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon 'Umar said: I know 

where it was revealed and on the day when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) had been at that time when it was revealed. It was revealed on the day of 'Arafa (ninth 

of Dhu'l Hijjah) and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been staying in 'Arafat. Sufyan 

said: I doubt, whether it was Friday or not (and the verse referred to) is this:" Today I have perfected 

your religion for you and completed My favours upon you" (v. 4).

Book 043, Number 7154: 

Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew said to 'Umar: If this verse were revealed in relation to the Jews 

(i. e." This day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed My favours for you and 

have chosen for you al-Islam as religion" ) we would have taken the day of rejoicing on which this 

verse was revealed. Thereupon 'Umar said: I know the day on which it was revealed and the hour 

when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been when it was 

revealed. It was revealed on the night of Friday and we were in 'Arafat with Alleh's Messenger (may

verse in your Book, which you recite. Had it been revealed in connection with the Jews, we would 

have taken it as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon he said: Which verse do you mean? He replied:" This

where it was revealed. It was revealed to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) at 'Arafat on 

Friday.

Book 043, Number 7156: 

'Urwa b. Zubair reported that he asked 'A'isha about the words of Allah:" If you fear that you will 

not be able to maintain equity amongst the orphan girls, then marry (those) you like from amongst 

the women two, three or four." She said: O, the son of my sister, the orphan girl is one who is under 

the patronage of her guardian and she shares with him in his property and her property and beauty 

fascinate him and her guardian makes up his mind to marry her without giving her due share of the 

wedding money and is not prepared (to pay so much amount) which anyone else is prepared to pay 

and so Allah has forbidden to marry these girls but in case when equity is observed as regards the 

wedding money and they are prepared to pay them the full amount of the wedding money and Allah 

commanded to marry other women besides them according to the liking of their heart. 'Urwa repor-

ted that 'A'isha said that people began to seek verdict from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 

him) after the revelation of this verse about them (orphan girls) and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, 

revealed this verse:" They asked thee verdict about women; say: Allah gives verdict to you in regard 

to them and what is recited to you in the Book about orphan woman, whom you give not what is or-

dained for them while you like to marry them" (iv. 126). She said: The wording of Allah" what is re-

cited to you" in the Book means the first verse, i. e." if you fear that you may not be able to observe 

equity in case of an orphan woman, marry what you like in case of woman" (iv. 3). 'A'isha said: (And 

as for this verse [iv. 126], i. e. and you intend" to marry one of them from amongst the orphan girls" 

it pertains to one who is in charge (of orphans) having small amount of wealth and less beauty and 

they have been forbidden that they should marry what they like of her wealth and beauty out of the 

orphan girls, but with equity, because of their disliking for them.

Book 043, Number 7157: 

'Urwa reported that he asked 'A'isha about the words of Allah:" If you fear that you will not be able 

to observe equity in case of orphan girls" ; the rest of the hadith is the same but with a slight variati-

on of wording.

Book 043, Number 7158: 

'A'isha said that as for the words of Allah:" If you fear that you would not be able to observe equity 

in case of orphan girls)," it was revealed in reference to a person who had an orphan girl (as his 

ward) and he was her guardian, and her heir, and she possessed property, but there was none to 

contend on her behalf except her ownself. And he (her guardian) did not give her in marriage be-

cause of her property and he tortured her and ill-treated her, it was in relation to her that (Allah 

said: )" If you fear that you would not be able to observe equity in case of orphan girls, then marry 

whom you like among women," i. e. whatever I have made lawful for you and leave her whom you 

are putting to torture.

Book 043, Number 7159: 

'A'isha said in connection with His words (those of Allah):" What is recited to you in the Book 

about orphan women whom you give not what is ordained for them, while you like to marry them," 

these were revealed in connection with an orphan girl who was in the charge of the person and she 

shared with him in his property and he was reluctant to marry her himself and was also unwilling to 

marry her to someone else (fearing) that (that person) would share in his property (as the husband 

of that girl), preventing her to marry, neither marrying her himself nor marrying her to another 

person.

Book 043, Number 7160: 

Hisham reported that 'A'isha said in connection with the words of Allah:" They ask thee the reli-

gious verdict about women, say: Allah gives you the verdict about them" (iv. 126), that these relate to 

an orphan girl who is in charge of the person and she shares with him in his property (as a heir) 

even in the date-palm trees and he is reluctant to give her hand in marriage to any other person lest 

he (her husband) should partake of his property, and thus keep her in a lingering state.

Book 043, Number 7161: 

Hisham reported on the authority of his father that 'A'isha said in connection with His (Allah's) 

words:" And whoever is poor let him take reasonably (out of it)" that it was revealed in connection 

with the custodian of the property of an orphan, who is in charge of her and looks after her; In case 

he is poor, he is allowed to eat out of that.

'A'isha said in connection with the verse:" And if a woman has reason to fear ill-treatment from

who had long association with a person (as his wife) and now he intends to divorce her and she says: 

Do not divorce me, but retain me (as wife in your house) and you are permitted to live with another 

wife. It is in this context that this verse was revealed.

Book 043, Number 7166: 

'A'isha said in connection with these words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:" And if a woman 

has reason to fear ill-treatment from her husband or that he might turn away from her" that it was 

revealed in case of a woman who lived with a person and perhaps he does not want to prolong (his 

relationship with her) whereas she has had sexual relationship with him (and as a result thereof) she 

got a child from him and she does not like that she should be divorced, so she says to him: I permit 

you to live with the other wife.

And they who call not upon another god with Allah and slay not the soul which Allah has forbidden, 

except in the cause of justice" (xxv. 68), he (Ibn Abbas) said: This has been revealed in regard to the

Ibn 'Abbas said: This verse was revealed in Mecca:" And they who call not upon another god with 

Allah and slay not the soul which Allah has forbidden except in the cause of justice" up to the word 

Muhdana (abased). Thereupon the polytheists said: Islam is of no avail to us for we have made peer 

with Allah and we killed the soul which Allah had forbidden to do and we committed debauchery, 

and it was (on this occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" Except him 

who repents and believes and does good deeds" up to the end Ibn 'Abbis says: He who enters the fold

prostitute" up to the words:" Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."

Chapter 5: Pertaining to the words of Allah: "Those 

whom they call upon, themselves seek the means of 

access to their lord" (xvii. 57) 

Book 043, Number 7182: 

Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported in connection with the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:" 

Those to whom they call upon, themselves seek the means or access to their Lord as to whoever of 

them becomes nearest" (xvii. 57) that it related to a party of Jinn who were being worshipped and 

they embraced Islam but those who worshipped them kept on worshipping them (though the Jinn 

whom the misguided people worshipped had become Muslims). It was then that this verse was re-

vealed.

Book 043, Number 7183: 

Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported in connection with the verse:" Those whom they call upon, themsel-

ves seek the means of access to their Lord," that it related to a group of people who worshipped a 

party amongst the Jinn. The group from amongst the Jinn embraced Islam, but the people kept wor-

shipping them as they did before, and it was (on this occasion) that the verse was revealed:" Those 

whom they call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord." This hadith has been narra-

ted on the authority of Sulaimin with the same chain of transmitters.

Book 043, Number 7184: 

Abdullah b. Mas'ud said in connection with the verse:" Those whom they call upon, themselves 

seek the means of access to their Lord," that that verse was revealed in connection with a party of 

Arabs who used to worship a group amnogst the jinn; the jinn embraced Islam but the people kept 

worshipping them without being conscious of it. Then this verse was revealed:" Those whom they 

call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord."

Chapter 6: Pertaining to suras Tauba, al-Anfal and 

Hashr 

Book 043, Number 7185: 

Sa'id b. Jubair reported: I said to Ibn 'Abbas about Sura Tauba, whereupon he said: As for Sura 

Tauba, it is meant to humiliate (the non-believers and the hypocrites). There is constantly revealed in 

it (the pronoun) minhum (of them) and minhom (of them, i. e. such is the condition of some of them) 

till they (the Muslims) thought that none would be left unmentioned out of them who would not be 

blamed (for one fault or the other). I again said: What about Sura Anfal? He said: It pertains to the 

Battle of Badr. I again asked him about Sura al-Hashr. He said: It was revealed in connection with 

(the tribe) of Banu Nadir.

Chapter 7: Pertaining to the prohibition of wine 

Book 043, Number 7186: 

Ibn 'Umar reported that Umar delivered a sermon on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (may peace 

be upon him) and he praised Allah and lauded Him and then said: Now coming to the point. Behold I 

when the command pertaining to the prohibition of wine was revealed, it was prepared from five 

things: from wheat, barley, date, grape, honey; and wine is that which clouds the intellect; and O 

people, I wish Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) could have explained to us in (more) de-

tail the laws pertaining to the inheritance of the grandfather, about one who dies leaving no issue, 

and some of the problems pertaining to interest.

Book 043, Number 7187: 

Ibn 'Umar reported: I heard 'Umar b. Khattab delivering sermon on the pulpit ol Allah's messenger 

(may peace be upon him) and saying': Now, coming to the point, O people, there was revealed (the 

command pertaining to the prohibition of wine) and it was prepared (at that time) out of five things: 

grape, date, honey, wheat, barley, and wine is that which clouds the intellect, and, O people, I wish 

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had explained to us in greater detail three things: the 

inheritance of the grandfather, of one who dies without leaving any issue, and some of the problems 

of interest.

Book 043, Number 7188: 

This hadith has been transmitted on the same authority but with a slight variation of wording.

vers of Mecca).
